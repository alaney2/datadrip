# Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a subfield of optimization that deals with minimizing convex functions over convex sets. It is a powerful tool in machine learning, as many problems in this field can be formulated as convex optimization problems. This wiki page will cover the basics of convex optimization, including definitions, examples, and algorithms.

## Convexity

A set $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is convex if, for any two points $x,y\in C$ and any $\theta\in[0,1]$, the point $\theta x+(1-\theta)y$ is also in $C$. In other words, a set is convex if the line segment connecting any two points in the set is entirely contained within the set.

A function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is convex if, for any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and any $\theta\in[0,1]$, we have $f(\theta x+(1-\theta)y)\leq\theta f(x)+(1-\theta)f(y)$. In other words, a function is convex if the line segment connecting any two points on or above the graph of the function is entirely contained above the graph.

## Convex Optimization Problems

A convex optimization problem is an optimization problem of the form

$$
\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad g_i(x)\leq0,\quad i=1,\ldots,m,\quad Ax=b,
$$

where $f$ is a convex function, $g_i$ are convex functions, and $A$ is a matrix. The inequality constraints $g_i(x)\leq0$ define a convex set $C$, and the equality constraints $Ax=b$ define an affine set.

Convex optimization problems have several desirable properties. For example, any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum, and any local minimum of a convex optimization problem is also a global minimum.

## Algorithms

There are several algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. One of the most basic algorithms is gradient descent, which iteratively updates the solution $x$ as

$$
x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\alpha_k\nabla f(x^{(k)}),
$$

where $\alpha_k$ is a step size parameter and $\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient of $f$ evaluated at $x$. Gradient descent can be slow for problems with highly curved surfaces, so other algorithms such as Newton's method or quasi-Newton methods may be more appropriate.

Another popular algorithm is the method of Lagrange multipliers, which converts a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem by introducing Lagrange multipliers. The resulting unconstrained problem can then be solved using gradient descent or other algorithms.

## Applications

Convex optimization has many applications in machine learning, including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural network training. In these applications, the objective function is typically a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output, and the constraints are often regularization terms that encourage certain properties of the model, such as sparsity or smoothness.

## Conclusion

Convex optimization is a powerful tool in machine learning for solving optimization problems with convex objectives and constraints. It has many applications in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. By understanding the basics of convex optimization and the algorithms used to solve it, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective and efficient machine learning models.
