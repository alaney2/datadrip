# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or simply neurons, that are organized into layers. The input layer receives the input data and the output layer produces the output, while the hidden layers perform computations on the input data. 

## Structure

The basic building block of an ANN is an artificial neuron, which consists of an input vector, a weight vector, a bias term, and an activation function. The input vector represents the input data, the weight vector represents the strength of the connections between the neurons, and the bias term represents the threshold for activation. The activation function determines whether the neuron fires or not, based on the weighted sum of the input vector and the bias term.

An ANN consists of multiple layers of artificial neurons, where each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. The first layer is the input layer, where the input data is fed into the network. The last layer is the output layer, where the final output of the network is produced. The layers in between the input and output layers are called hidden layers, and they perform computations on the input data. 

## Training

The process of training an ANN involves adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This is done by using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to iteratively update the weights and biases based on the errors between the predicted and actual outputs. The most common algorithm for training ANNs is backpropagation, which uses the chain rule of calculus to calculate the gradient of the error with respect to the weights and biases.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions determine the output of a neuron based on its input. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, which maps any input to a value between 0 and 1, and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, which returns the input if it is positive and 0 otherwise. 

## Applications

ANNs have been used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and game playing. One of the most successful applications of ANNs is in deep learning, which involves training ANNs with multiple hidden layers. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are two examples of deep learning models based on ANNs.

In summary, artificial neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks.
