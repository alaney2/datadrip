# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve at a task with experience. Machine learning algorithms have the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved by analyzing and learning from patterns in data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. The labeled dataset consists of inputs and corresponding outputs. The goal of the algorithm is to learn the mapping between the inputs and outputs so that it can accurately predict the output for new inputs.

### Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal of the algorithm is to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any specific output to predict. Unsupervised learning can be used for tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. The environment provides feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions taken by the algorithm. The goal of the algorithm is to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward.
