# Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno Algorithm

The Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is a widely used optimization method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. It is an iterative method that belongs to the class of Quasi-Newton methods, which are designed to approximate the Newton-Raphson method for optimization without requiring the computation of the Hessian matrix. The BFGS algorithm is particularly popular due to its efficiency and robustness in solving a wide range of optimization problems.

## Overview

The BFGS algorithm is based on the idea of approximating the Hessian matrix of the objective function using information from the gradient. The main advantage of this approach is that it avoids the need to compute the Hessian matrix explicitly, which can be computationally expensive or even infeasible for large-scale problems. Instead, the BFGS algorithm updates an approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix at each iteration using only gradient information.

The BFGS algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the secant method for multidimensional optimization problems. The secant method is a root-finding algorithm that approximates the derivative of a function using finite differences. Similarly, the BFGS algorithm approximates the Hessian matrix using differences of gradients.

## Algorithm

The BFGS algorithm starts with an initial guess for the solution, $x_0$, and an initial approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix, $H_0$. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the search direction, $p_k$, by solving the linear system:


$$

H_k p_k = -\nabla f(x_k)

$$


where $\nabla f(x_k)$ is the gradient of the objective function at the current iterate, $x_k$. The search direction is then used to perform a line search along the direction $p_k$ to find the step size, $\alpha_k$, that minimizes the objective function:


$$

x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k

$$


The inverse Hessian approximation, $H_{k+1}$, is then updated using the following formula:


$$

H_{k+1} = \left(I - \frac{s_k y_k^T}{y_k^T s_k}\right) H_k \left(I - \frac{y_k s_k^T}{y_k^T s_k}\right) + \frac{s_k s_k^T}{y_k^T s_k}

$$


where $s_k = x_{k+1} - x_k$ and $y_k = \nabla f(x_{k+1}) - \nabla f(x_k)$, and $I$ is the identity matrix. This update formula ensures that the updated matrix $H_{k+1}$ remains positive definite, which is a desirable property for optimization algorithms.

The algorithm continues iterating until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a tolerance on the gradient norm.

## Convergence

The BFGS algorithm has been shown to have strong convergence properties under certain conditions. In particular, if the objective function is twice continuously differentiable and its Hessian matrix is Lipschitz continuous, then the BFGS algorithm converges globally and superlinearly to the solution. This means that the rate of convergence increases with the number of iterations, making the algorithm particularly efficient for solving smooth optimization problems.

## Variants

There are several variants of the BFGS algorithm that have been proposed to improve its performance or adapt it to specific problem classes. Some of these variants include:

- Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS): A memory-efficient variant of the BFGS algorithm that stores only a limited number of past updates to the inverse Hessian approximation. This makes the algorithm more suitable for large-scale problems where the full BFGS update would be too expensive in terms of memory requirements.

- Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with Box constraints (BFGS-B): An extension of the BFGS algorithm to handle box constraints on the variables, i.e., bounds on the feasible region of the optimization problem.

- Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with Line search (BFGS-LS): A variant of the BFGS algorithm that uses a more sophisticated line search strategy to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

## Applications

The BFGS algorithm is widely used in various fields of science and engineering for solving unconstrained optimization problems. Some common applications include:

- Machine learning: Training of neural networks, support vector machines, and other models that involve minimizing a loss function.

- Computational chemistry: Optimization of molecular structures and potential energy surfaces.

- Operations research: Solving linear and nonlinear programming problems, such as resource allocation and scheduling.

- Control theory: Design of optimal controllers and state estimators for dynamical systems.

- Image processing: Denoising, segmentation, and registration of images.

In summary, the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno algorithm is a powerful optimization method that has been widely adopted in various fields due to its efficiency and robustness. Its ability to approximate the Hessian matrix using only gradient information makes it particularly attractive for large-scale problems where the computation of the Hessian matrix is infeasible or expensive.
