# Interpolation

Interpolation is a technique used in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to estimate unknown values within a range of known data points. It is commonly used in applications such as image processing, computer graphics, and data fitting. The main idea behind interpolation is to find a function that passes through the given data points and can be used to predict the value of a new point within the range of the known data.

There are several methods for interpolation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common interpolation methods include linear interpolation, polynomial interpolation, spline interpolation, and kernel-based interpolation.

## Linear Interpolation

Linear interpolation is the simplest form of interpolation. It involves estimating the value of a new point by drawing a straight line between the two nearest known data points. The value of the new point is then determined by the position of the point on the line. Mathematically, linear interpolation can be expressed as:


$$

y = y_1 + \frac{(x - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)}{x_2 - x_1}

$$


Where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two nearest known data points, and $(x, y)$ is the coordinate of the new point.

Linear interpolation is easy to implement and computationally efficient, but it may not provide accurate results when the underlying function is nonlinear or when the data points are not evenly spaced.

## Polynomial Interpolation

Polynomial interpolation involves fitting a polynomial function to the given data points. The polynomial function is of the form:


$$

P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n

$$


Where $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n$ are the coefficients of the polynomial, and $n$ is the degree of the polynomial. The coefficients are determined by solving a system of linear equations that ensures the polynomial passes through all the given data points.

Polynomial interpolation can provide more accurate results than linear interpolation, especially when the underlying function is nonlinear. However, it can suffer from the Runge's phenomenon, which causes oscillations near the edges of the interpolation range when the degree of the polynomial is high. To overcome this issue, one can use piecewise polynomial interpolation, such as spline interpolation.

## Spline Interpolation

Spline interpolation is a piecewise polynomial interpolation technique that divides the range of the known data points into smaller intervals and fits a low-degree polynomial to each interval. The most common type of spline interpolation is cubic spline interpolation, which fits a cubic polynomial to each interval. The cubic splines are designed to be smooth and continuous at the interval boundaries, ensuring a smooth overall function.

Spline interpolation can provide more accurate results than polynomial interpolation, especially for functions with rapid changes or oscillations. It is also less susceptible to the Runge's phenomenon. However, spline interpolation can be more computationally expensive than linear or polynomial interpolation, as it requires solving a system of linear equations for each interval.

## Kernel-based Interpolation

Kernel-based interpolation, also known as kernel regression or kernel smoothing, is a nonparametric interpolation technique that estimates the value of a new point by taking a weighted average of the known data points. The weights are determined by a kernel function, which measures the similarity between the new point and the known data points. Some common kernel functions include the Gaussian kernel, the Epanechnikov kernel, and the tri-cube kernel.

Kernel-based interpolation can provide more accurate results than linear or polynomial interpolation, especially for functions with complex or irregular shapes. It is also more robust to noise and outliers in the data. However, kernel-based interpolation can be computationally expensive, as it requires calculating the kernel function for each known data point.

In conclusion, interpolation is a powerful technique for estimating unknown values within a range of known data points. The choice of interpolation method depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the underlying function. Linear interpolation is the simplest and most computationally efficient method, while polynomial, spline, and kernel-based interpolation can provide more accurate results for nonlinear or irregular functions.
