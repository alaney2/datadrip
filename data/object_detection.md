# Object Detection

Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves detecting and localizing objects within an image or video. It has widespread applications in various domains such as self-driving cars, robotics, security systems, and medical imaging. Object detection algorithms typically use deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically learn features that can distinguish between different objects. 

## History

Before the advent of deep learning, object detection was primarily achieved using hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs) and decision trees. However, these methods were limited in their ability to generalize to new objects and environments. With the rise of deep learning, object detection algorithms have significantly improved in accuracy and efficiency.

## Techniques

Object detection algorithms typically follow a two-stage approach: 

1. Region proposal generation: This stage involves generating a set of candidate object regions in the image using techniques such as selective search, edge boxes, or region proposal networks (RPNs). 

2. Object classification and localization: This stage involves classifying each region proposal as either containing an object of interest or not, and refining the bounding box coordinates of the object if present. This is typically accomplished using CNNs, with architectures such as You Only Look Once (YOLO), Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet, and EfficientDet being popular choices.

## Evaluation Metrics

Object detection algorithms are typically evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). Precision measures the fraction of correctly detected objects out of all detected objects, while recall measures the fraction of correctly detected objects out of all ground truth objects. mAP is a widely used metric that combines precision and recall across different object categories and detection thresholds.
