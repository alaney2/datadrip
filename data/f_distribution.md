# F Distribution

The F distribution is a probability distribution that arises in hypothesis testing, particularly in the comparison of variances of two or more populations. It is characterized by two parameters, the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the degrees of freedom of the denominator. The F distribution is a continuous probability distribution with a range of values between 0 and positive infinity.

## Probability Density Function

The probability density function (PDF) of the F distribution is given by:

$$ f(x; d_1, d_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(d_1 x)^{d_1} d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1 x + d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}}{x B(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2})}, \quad x > 0 $$

where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the degrees of freedom of the numerator and denominator, respectively, and $B(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2})$ is the beta function.

## Properties

Some of the key properties of the F distribution are:

- The F distribution is a non-negative continuous probability distribution.
- The mean of the F distribution is $\frac{d_2}{d_2-2}$ for $d_2 > 2$.
- The variance of the F distribution is $\frac{2d_2^2(d_1+d_2-2)}{d_1(d_2-2)^2(d_2-4)}$ for $d_2 > 4$.
- The F distribution is skewed to the right.
- The F distribution is unimodal for $d_1 > 2$.

## Application in Hypothesis Testing

The F distribution is commonly used in hypothesis testing, particularly in the comparison of variances of two or more populations. The F statistic is calculated as the ratio of the sample variances of the populations being compared. The F distribution is then used to determine the p-value of the test, which is compared to the level of significance to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected.
