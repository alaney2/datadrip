# Order Statistics

Order statistics are statistics that describe the relative standing of values in a dataset. They are particularly useful in nonparametric statistics, where the underlying distribution of the data is unknown or not assumed. The most common order statistics are the minimum, maximum, and median values of a dataset, but other order statistics can be defined as well.

## Definition

Given a set of $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, the order statistics are the sorted values of these random variables, denoted as $X_{(1)}, X_{(2)}, \dots, X_{(n)}$, where $X_{(1)} \leq X_{(2)} \leq \dots \leq X_{(n)}$. The $k$-th order statistic, $X_{(k)}$, is the $k$-th smallest value in the dataset.

## Distribution of Order Statistics

The probability distribution of an order statistic can be derived from the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the underlying random variables. Let $F(x)$ be the CDF and $f(x)$ be the PDF of the random variables $X_i$. The CDF of the $k$-th order statistic, $F_{(k)}(x)$, is given by:


$$

F_{(k)}(x) = P(X_{(k)} \leq x) = \sum_{j=k}^n {n \choose j} F(x)^j (1 - F(x))^{n-j}

$$


The PDF of the $k$-th order statistic, $f_{(k)}(x)$, can be obtained by differentiating the CDF with respect to $x$:


$$

f_{(k)}(x) = \frac{dF_{(k)}(x)}{dx} = n {n-1 \choose k-1} f(x) F(x)^{k-1} (1 - F(x))^{n-k}

$$


## Properties of Order Statistics

1. **Expectation and Variance**: The expectation and variance of the $k$-th order statistic can be computed using the distribution of the order statistic. In general, the expectation and variance depend on the underlying distribution of the random variables.

2. **Joint Distribution**: The joint distribution of two order statistics, say $X_{(i)}$ and $X_{(j)}$ with $i < j$, can be derived from the CDF and PDF of the underlying random variables. The joint PDF is given by:

    
$$

    f_{(i), (j)}(x, y) = \frac{n!}{(i-1)!(j-i-1)!(n-j)!} f(x) f(y) F(x)^{i-1} (F(y) - F(x))^{j-i-1} (1 - F(y))^{n-j}
    
$$


3. **Independence**: Order statistics are generally not independent, as the value of one order statistic influences the possible values of the others. However, under certain conditions, such as when the underlying random variables are exponentially distributed, some order statistics can be independent.

4. **Convergence**: As the sample size $n$ increases, the distribution of the order statistics converges to the underlying distribution of the random variables. This property is useful in nonparametric statistics, where the goal is often to estimate the underlying distribution without making assumptions about its form.

5. **Percentiles and Quantiles**: Order statistics can be used to estimate percentiles and quantiles of the underlying distribution. The $p$-th percentile of a distribution is the value below which a given percentage $p$ of the data falls. The $k$-th quantile is a value that divides the data into $k$ equal parts. For example, the median is the 50th percentile and the 2nd quantile.

## Applications of Order Statistics

1. **Nonparametric Statistics**: Order statistics are widely used in nonparametric statistics, where the goal is to make inferences about the underlying distribution without making assumptions about its form. Examples of nonparametric methods that use order statistics include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test.

2. **Extreme Value Theory**: Order statistics play a crucial role in extreme value theory, which studies the behavior of extreme values in a dataset. The maximum and minimum order statistics are used to model the largest and smallest values, respectively, and can be used to estimate the probability of extreme events.

3. **Rank Statistics**: Order statistics can be used to compute rank statistics, which are statistics based on the ranks of the data values. Examples of rank statistics include the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

4. **Sample Order Statistics**: In practice, order statistics are often computed from a sample of data rather than from the entire population. Sample order statistics can be used to estimate population order statistics and to make inferences about the underlying distribution.

5. **Outlier Detection**: Order statistics can be used to detect outliers in a dataset. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data and may indicate errors or unusual events. The minimum and maximum order statistics, as well as other high-order statistics, can be used to identify potential outliers.
