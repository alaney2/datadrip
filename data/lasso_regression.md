# Lasso Regression

Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, is a linear regression model that uses L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model interpretability. Lasso Regression was introduced by Robert Tibshirani in 1996 as a method for variable selection and shrinkage in linear regression models.

## Overview

Lasso Regression is an extension of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the objective function. The objective function for Lasso Regression is given by:


$$

\min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i^T \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j|

$$


where $n$ is the number of samples, $x_i$ is the feature vector for the $i$-th sample, $y_i$ is the target value for the $i$-th sample, $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, $p$ is the number of features, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.

The L1 regularization term, $\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j|$, encourages sparsity in the model by driving some of the coefficients to zero. This results in a model that is more interpretable and less prone to overfitting, as it uses fewer features.

## Comparison with Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is another linear regression model that uses regularization to prevent overfitting. However, Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which is given by:


$$

\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2

$$


The main difference between Lasso and Ridge Regression is the type of regularization used. Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to zero. Ridge Regression, on the other hand, uses L2 regularization, which does not encourage sparsity but instead shrinks the coefficients towards zero.

In general, Lasso Regression is preferred when the number of features is large, and only a few of them are expected to be relevant. Ridge Regression is more suitable when all features are expected to contribute to the model.

## Solution Methods

There are several methods to solve the Lasso Regression problem, including:

1. **Coordinate Descent**: This is an iterative optimization algorithm that updates one coordinate (or feature) at a time while keeping the others fixed. Coordinate Descent is particularly efficient for Lasso Regression because the L1 regularization term makes the objective function separable.

2. **Least Angle Regression (LARS)**: LARS is an algorithm that computes the Lasso solution by iteratively moving along the equiangular direction between the current active set of features. LARS is computationally efficient and can be used for high-dimensional problems.

3. **Gradient Descent**: Gradient Descent is a general optimization algorithm that can be used to solve the Lasso Regression problem. However, due to the non-differentiability of the L1 regularization term, a variant called Subgradient Descent or Proximal Gradient Descent is used.

4. **Interior Point Methods**: These are optimization algorithms that solve the Lasso problem by transforming it into a sequence of smooth, unconstrained problems. Interior Point Methods are more computationally expensive than Coordinate Descent or LARS but can be more accurate.

## Limitations

Lasso Regression has some limitations, including:

1. **Selection of Regularization Parameter**: The choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ can significantly affect the performance of the model. A too-small value of $\lambda$ may lead to overfitting, while a too-large value may lead to underfitting. Cross-validation is often used to select the optimal value of $\lambda$.

2. **Multicollinearity**: Lasso Regression can be sensitive to multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more features are highly correlated. In such cases, Lasso may select only one of the correlated features and ignore the others, leading to an unstable model.

3. **Grouped Features**: Lasso Regression tends to select only one feature from a group of correlated features, which can be problematic if the features within the group have a similar effect on the target variable. In such cases, a variant called Group Lasso can be used to enforce group-wise sparsity.

## Conclusion

Lasso Regression is a powerful linear regression model that uses L1 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model interpretability. It is particularly useful when the number of features is large, and only a few of them are expected to be relevant. Lasso Regression has some limitations, such as sensitivity to multicollinearity and the selection of the regularization parameter, but it remains a popular method for linear regression problems with high-dimensional data.
