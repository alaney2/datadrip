# Quantum Eigenvalue Algorithm

The Quantum Eigenvalue Algorithm (QEA) is a quantum algorithm designed to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given matrix faster than classical algorithms. It is an important subfield of quantum computing and finds applications in various fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and machine learning.

## Background

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in linear algebra and find applications in various scientific fields. A matrix A is said to have an eigenvector v and eigenvalue λ if Av = λv. In classical computing, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix is computationally expensive, with the best known classical algorithms having a runtime that scales as O(n^3), where n is the size of the matrix. 

In contrast, quantum computers can perform certain linear algebraic operations exponentially faster than classical computers. The QEA is one such algorithm that is designed to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given matrix faster than classical algorithms.

## Algorithm

The QEA uses the quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE) to find the eigenvalues of the matrix. The QPE is a quantum algorithm that estimates the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. It works by preparing an initial state and evolving it under the unitary operator for a certain number of times. The resulting state is then measured, and the eigenvalues can be estimated from the measurement outcomes.

The QEA uses the QPE to estimate the eigenvalues of the matrix and then uses a quantum algorithm known as the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to find the eigenvectors. The QFT is a quantum version of the discrete Fourier transform and is used to convert the eigenvalue estimates obtained from the QPE into the corresponding eigenvectors. 

## Applications

The QEA finds applications in various scientific fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and machine learning. In quantum chemistry, the QEA is used to solve the electronic structure problem, which involves finding the ground state energy and wave function of a molecule. In condensed matter physics, the QEA is used to study the properties of materials and their interactions. In machine learning, the QEA is used for principal component analysis and other linear algebraic operations.
