# Number Theory

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers. It is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of mathematics, and has applications in many fields, including computer science and cryptography.

## Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a fundamental concept in number theory, which deals with arithmetic operations on integers modulo a fixed integer. It is denoted by the symbol "mod". For example, "a mod b" denotes the remainder when "a" is divided by "b". Modular arithmetic has many applications, including in cryptography, where it is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are a central concept in number theory. A prime number is a positive integer that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers. Prime numbers have many interesting properties, and are used extensively in number theory and cryptography.

## Euclidean Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is based on the observation that the GCD of two integers is the same as the GCD of one of the integers and the remainder of the division of the other integer by the first. The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms known, and is still widely used today.

## RSA Algorithm

The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptography algorithm that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The RSA algorithm is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

## Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves are a type of algebraic curve that has many interesting properties. They are used extensively in number theory, and have applications in cryptography, computer graphics, and coding theory. Elliptic curves are also used in the construction of public-key cryptography algorithms, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

## Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem is a fundamental theorem in number theory, named after Pierre de Fermat. It states that if "p" is a prime number and "a" is any integer not divisible by "p", then "a^(p-1) mod p = 1". Fermat's Little Theorem is used extensively in number theory and cryptography.
