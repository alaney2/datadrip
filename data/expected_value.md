# Expected Value

In probability theory and statistics, the expected value (also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, mean, or first moment) is a fundamental concept that measures the central tendency of a random variable. Given a random variable $X$, the expected value of $X$, denoted as $E[X]$ or $\mu$, is the weighted average of all possible values that $X$ can take on, with the weights being the probabilities of these values.

## Definition

The expected value of a discrete random variable $X$ with probability mass function $p(x)$ is defined as:


$$

E[X] = \sum_{x} x \cdot p(x)

$$


where the sum is taken over all possible values of $X$.

For a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x)$, the expected value is defined as:


$$

E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx

$$


In both cases, the expected value can be thought of as the "center of mass" of the probability distribution of the random variable.

## Properties

The expected value has several important properties that make it a useful tool in probability theory and statistics:

1. **Linearity**: For any random variables $X$ and $Y$, and constants $a$ and $b$, the expected value is linear, i.e.,

   
$$

   E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]
   
$$


2. **Monotonicity**: If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables such that $X \leq Y$, then $E[X] \leq E[Y]$.

3. **Jensen's inequality**: For any convex function $\phi$, and any random variable $X$,

   
$$

   E[\phi(X)] \geq \phi(E[X])
   
$$


4. **Tower property**: If $X$ is a random variable and $Y$ is a random variable that is measurable with respect to the sigma-algebra generated by $X$, then

   
$$

   E[E[Y|X]] = E[Y]
   
$$


   This property is also known as the law of iterated expectations.

## Applications

The expected value is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, insurance, and decision theory. Some common applications include:

1. **Risk analysis**: In finance and insurance, the expected value is used to quantify the potential losses associated with uncertain events, such as stock price fluctuations or natural disasters.

2. **Decision making under uncertainty**: In decision theory, the expected value is used to evaluate the desirability of different actions by calculating the expected payoff of each action, given the probabilities of different outcomes.

3. **Statistical estimation**: In statistics, the expected value is used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different estimators. For example, an unbiased estimator is one whose expected value is equal to the true parameter value being estimated.

4. **Law of large numbers**: The expected value plays a central role in the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables converges to their common expected value.

5. **Central limit theorem**: The expected value is also a key component of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, converges to a normal distribution with mean equal to the sum of their expected values and variance equal to the sum of their variances.

## Limitations

While the expected value is a useful measure of central tendency, it has some limitations:

1. **Sensitivity to extreme values**: The expected value can be heavily influenced by extreme values in the distribution, which may not accurately represent the "typical" value of the random variable.

2. **Not always representative**: In some cases, the expected value may not be a good representative of the distribution, especially for highly skewed or multimodal distributions.

3. **Undefined for some distributions**: The expected value may not exist for some distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, which has no finite mean.

Despite these limitations, the expected value remains a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, with numerous applications in various fields.
