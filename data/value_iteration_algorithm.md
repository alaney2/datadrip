# Value Iteration Algorithm

The **Value Iteration Algorithm** is a dynamic programming algorithm used to compute the optimal value function and policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an initial estimate of the value function and updates it in each iteration until convergence. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal value function and policy for the given MDP.

## Algorithm

The algorithm starts with an initial estimate of the value function, denoted by V_0. In each iteration, it updates the value function using the Bellman optimality equation:

$$V_{k+1}(s) = \max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V_k(s')]$$

where V_k is the value function at iteration k, s is the current state, a is the action taken in state s, s' is the next state, P(s'|s,a) is the transition probability from state s to state s' under action a, R(s,a,s') is the reward obtained for transitioning from state s to state s' under action a, and \gamma is the discount factor.

The algorithm continues to iterate until the difference between the value function in two consecutive iterations is less than a predefined threshold, denoted by \epsilon.

Once the algorithm converges, the optimal policy can be obtained by selecting the action that maximizes the right-hand side of the Bellman optimality equation for each state:

$$\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_{a \in A} \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^*(s')]$$

where V^* is the optimal value function.

## Applications

The Value Iteration Algorithm is widely used in various fields, including robotics, game theory, and finance. It is used to solve problems that can be modeled as MDPs, such as robot navigation, game playing, and portfolio optimization.
