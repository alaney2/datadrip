# Asynchronous Hyperband

Asynchronous Hyperband is a method for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning (ML) that combines the strengths of Hyperband and asynchronous optimization methods. This combination allows for efficient and effective exploration of the hyperparameter space, even in settings where the computational resources are limited or the evaluation of the hyperparameters is time-consuming.

## Overview

Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in the development of ML models. The performance of these models often depends heavily on the choice of hyperparameters, which control aspects of the model such as the learning rate, the regularization strength, and the complexity of the model architecture.

Hyperband is a method for hyperparameter optimization that is based on the multi-armed bandit problem and the principle of successive halving. It allocates resources to different configurations of hyperparameters based on their performance, quickly discarding poor-performing configurations and allocating more resources to promising ones.

Asynchronous optimization methods, on the other hand, are designed to optimize the use of computational resources. They allow for the evaluation of different configurations of hyperparameters to proceed independently and in parallel, without the need for synchronization between the evaluations.

Asynchronous Hyperband combines these two approaches. It uses the resource allocation strategy of Hyperband, but allows for the evaluations to proceed asynchronously. This means that it can start evaluating a new configuration of hyperparameters as soon as the computational resources become available, without having to wait for other evaluations to finish.

## Algorithm

The Asynchronous Hyperband algorithm proceeds in rounds. In each round, it samples a set of hyperparameter configurations and evaluates them using a certain amount of computational resources. The performance of each configuration is then used to determine which configurations will be evaluated in the next round.

The amount of resources allocated to each configuration is determined by the Hyperband strategy. Initially, a small amount of resources is allocated to each configuration. Configurations that perform well are then allocated more resources in the next round, while poor-performing configurations are discarded.

The asynchronous aspect of the algorithm comes into play in the evaluation of the configurations. Instead of evaluating all configurations in parallel, as in the original Hyperband algorithm, Asynchronous Hyperband allows for the evaluations to proceed independently. This means that as soon as the evaluation of a configuration is finished, a new configuration can be sampled and its evaluation can start, without having to wait for the other evaluations to finish.

## Benefits and Limitations

The main benefit of Asynchronous Hyperband is its efficiency. By combining the resource allocation strategy of Hyperband with the asynchronous evaluation of configurations, it can explore the hyperparameter space more quickly and effectively than other methods.

However, like all hyperparameter optimization methods, Asynchronous Hyperband has its limitations. It relies on the assumption that the performance of a configuration can be accurately estimated with a small amount of resources, which may not always be the case. Furthermore, it requires a method for sampling the hyperparameter space, which can be challenging in high-dimensional spaces.

Despite these limitations, Asynchronous Hyperband has been shown to be a powerful tool for hyperparameter optimization in a wide range of ML applications.
