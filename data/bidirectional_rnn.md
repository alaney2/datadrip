# Bidirectional RNN

A Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is capable of processing a sequence of data in both directions, from the beginning to the end as well as from the end to the beginning. This is achieved by introducing two hidden layers, one that processes the input sequence in a forward direction and another that processes the input sequence in a reverse direction. The outputs of both layers are then combined to produce the final output.

## Structure of a Bidirectional RNN

A Bidirectional RNN consists of two hidden layers, one that processes the input sequence in the forward direction and another that processes the input sequence in the reverse direction. The outputs of both layers are then combined to produce the final output. The following diagram shows the structure of a Bidirectional RNN:

## Applications of Bidirectional RNN

Bidirectional RNNs have shown great success in various applications, including:

- Speech recognition: Bidirectional RNNs have been used to improve the performance of speech recognition systems by taking into account the context of the speech signal in both directions.
- Natural language processing: Bidirectional RNNs have been used for language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, among other tasks.
- Computer vision: Bidirectional RNNs have been used for video classification, action recognition, and image captioning, among other tasks.

## Training of Bidirectional RNN

The training of a Bidirectional RNN is typically done using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm, which is a variant of the Backpropagation algorithm that is used to train RNNs. During training, the weights of both the forward and backward layers are updated based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

## Advantages of Bidirectional RNN

The main advantages of Bidirectional RNNs are:

- They are capable of capturing both the past and future context of a sequence.
- They can improve the performance of many sequence processing tasks, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.

## Conclusion

In summary, Bidirectional RNNs are a powerful extension of RNNs that are capable of processing a sequence of data in both directions, from the beginning to the end as well as from the end to the beginning. They have shown great success in various applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision.
