# Data Wrangling

Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. The data transformations are typically applied to distinct entities (such as fields, rows, columns, data values etc.) within a data set, and could include such actions as extractions, parsing, joining, standardizing, augmenting, cleansing, consolidating and filtering to create desired wrangling outcomes.

## Overview

Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves cleaning, structuring and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision making in less time. Data wrangling is increasingly ubiquitous at today's top firms. Data has become more diverse and unstructured, demanding increased time spent culling, cleaning, and organizing data ahead of broader analysis. At the same time, with data informing just about every business decision, business users have less time to wait on technical resources for prepared data.

## Process

Data wrangling typically involves several stages, each of which increases the quality of the data and adds value to the downstream analytics:

1. **Discovering**: First, the data scientist needs to explore the data set in order to understand its content, structure and quality. Initial statistics and visualizations help to understand whether the data set contains the information it was supposed to contain.

2. **Structuring**: Raw data comes in all shapes and sizes. The data scientist may need to structure the data, which could involve combining data, splitting it up, or transforming it into a completely different format.

3. **Cleaning**: Data cleaning involves handling missing data and outliers, and checking the data for consistency and quality. This is often a very time-consuming process, but it is necessary to avoid errors in the analysis.

4. **Enriching**: In this stage, the data scientist may choose to enrich the data with additional data sources, adding more variables or more observations.

5. **Validating**: The data scientist needs to validate the data that has been wrangled, using statistical methods to ensure that it makes sense and is reliable.

6. **Publishing**: The final stage of data wrangling involves publishing the data set in a format that can be used in the downstream analytics process, often in a data warehouse or a similar repository.

## Tools

There are several tools available for data wrangling, including open-source programming languages like Python and R, and commercial software like Trifacta and Alteryx. Python, in particular, has several libraries like Pandas and NumPy that are specifically designed for data wrangling.

## Conclusion

Data wrangling is an essential step in the data analysis process. It involves a wide range of skills and techniques, but the goal is always the same: to transform raw data into a format that can be used for analysis. Despite being time-consuming, data wrangling is a crucial aspect of any data-driven decision making process.
