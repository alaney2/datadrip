# Variational Autoencoder

A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised representation learning and generative modeling. It is a probabilistic version of the autoencoder architecture that uses a probabilistic latent variable model to encode input data into a low-dimensional latent space and then decode it back to the original input space. It can also generate new data from the learned latent space.

## Architecture

The architecture of a VAE consists of two main parts: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network maps the input data to a low-dimensional latent space, which is a probability distribution over the latent variables. The decoder network takes a sample from this distribution and maps it back to the input space.

The encoder network consists of several layers of neural networks that map the input data to the mean and standard deviation of the distribution over the latent variables. The decoder network takes a sample from this distribution and generates the output data.

## Training

The training of a VAE involves minimizing the reconstruction loss and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the learned latent distribution and the prior distribution. The reconstruction loss measures the difference between the input and the output data, while the KL divergence measures the difference between the learned latent distribution and the prior distribution.

The objective function for a VAE is given by:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p(z))$$

where $q_\phi(z|x)$ is the encoder's approximation of the true posterior distribution $p(z|x)$, $p_\theta(x|z)$ is the decoder's output, $p(z)$ is the prior distribution over the latent variables, and $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

The first term is the reconstruction loss, which measures the reconstruction error between the input and the output data. The second term is the KL divergence, which measures how different the learned latent distribution is from the prior distribution.

## Applications

VAEs have been applied to a wide range of tasks, including image and video generation, text generation, anomaly detection, and data imputation. They have also been used in combination with other deep learning techniques, such as adversarial training and reinforcement learning.
