# ResNet Versions

ResNet, short for Residual Networks, is a family of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have been widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The key innovation of ResNet is the introduction of residual connections, which enable the network to learn residual functions and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. Since the introduction of the original ResNet architecture, several variants have been proposed to improve its performance and efficiency. This article provides an overview of the main ResNet versions, including the original ResNet, Pre-Activation ResNet, ResNeXt, and Wide ResNet.

## Original ResNet

The original ResNet architecture was proposed by Kaiming He et al. in their 2015 paper, "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition." The main idea behind ResNet is to use residual connections, also known as skip connections or shortcut connections, to allow the network to learn residual functions instead of directly learning the desired mapping. This is achieved by adding the input of a layer to its output, effectively allowing the network to learn the difference between the input and output, which is the residual function.

The original ResNet architecture consists of several residual blocks, each containing two or more convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. The residual connections are added after the second convolutional layer in each block. The network is trained using the standard backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization.

ResNet has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks, such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). The original ResNet paper proposed several variants with different numbers of layers, including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152.

## Pre-Activation ResNet

In 2016, Kaiming He et al. proposed a modified version of the original ResNet architecture called Pre-Activation ResNet. The main difference between the original ResNet and Pre-Activation ResNet is the order of the layers in the residual blocks. In Pre-Activation ResNet, the batch normalization and ReLU activation functions are applied before the convolutional layers, instead of after them.

The motivation behind this change is to improve the information flow through the network and make it easier to train deeper models. Pre-Activation ResNet has been shown to achieve better performance than the original ResNet on various image classification benchmarks, with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity.

## ResNeXt

ResNeXt, short for Residual Networks with NeXt-generation connections, is another variant of ResNet proposed by Xie et al. in 2017. The main idea behind ResNeXt is to use a more flexible and modular architecture, which allows for better scalability and performance.

ResNeXt introduces a new building block called the "split-transform-merge" block, which consists of multiple parallel branches, each containing a series of convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. The outputs of these branches are then combined using a merge operation, such as element-wise addition or concatenation.

The key innovation of ResNeXt is the use of "cardinality," which refers to the number of parallel branches in the split-transform-merge block. By increasing the cardinality, the network can learn more complex and diverse features, leading to better performance. ResNeXt has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks, with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity compared to the original ResNet.

## Wide ResNet

Wide ResNet, proposed by Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis in 2016, is another variant of ResNet that aims to improve the performance and efficiency of the original architecture. The main idea behind Wide ResNet is to increase the width of the network, i.e., the number of channels in each convolutional layer, instead of increasing the depth.

Wide ResNet uses a modified version of the original ResNet residual block, with more channels in each convolutional layer. This allows the network to learn more complex and diverse features, leading to better performance. Wide ResNet has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks, with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity compared to the original ResNet.

## Conclusion

ResNet and its variants have significantly advanced the state of the art in deep learning for computer vision tasks. The introduction of residual connections has enabled the training of much deeper networks, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks. The different ResNet versions, such as Pre-Activation ResNet, ResNeXt, and Wide ResNet, offer various trade-offs between performance, complexity, and scalability, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
