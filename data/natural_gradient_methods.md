# Natural Gradient Methods

Natural gradient methods are a class of optimization algorithms used in machine learning to update the parameters of a model. Unlike traditional gradient descent methods, which use the Euclidean distance to update the parameters, natural gradient methods use the Fisher information matrix to take into account the geometry of the parameter space.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the loss function of a model. It works by updating the parameters of the model in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. SGD is a simple and efficient algorithm, but it can be slow to converge and may get stuck in local minima.

## Information Geometry

Information geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the geometry of probability distributions. It provides a framework for understanding the geometry of the parameter space and the curvature of the loss function. The Fisher information matrix is a key concept in information geometry and is used in natural gradient methods.

## Fisher Information Matrix

The Fisher information matrix is a matrix that measures the curvature of the loss function with respect to the parameters of a model. It is used in natural gradient methods to take into account the geometry of the parameter space. The Fisher information matrix can be difficult to compute, especially for large models, but there are efficient algorithms for approximating it.
