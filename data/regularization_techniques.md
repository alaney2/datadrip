# Regularization Techniques

Regularization techniques are employed in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of models to unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization adds constraints or penalties to the learning process, discouraging overly complex models.

## L1 and L2 Regularization

L1 and L2 regularization are common techniques used to add penalties to the objective function during training. These penalties are based on the magnitudes of the model's parameters and encourage simpler models with smaller weights.

### L1 Regularization

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's weights to the loss function. This encourages sparsity in the model, often resulting in some weights being exactly zero.

### L2 Regularization

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization or weight decay, adds the sum of the squares of the model's weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, but does not enforce sparsity like L1 regularization.

## Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models, particularly neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a proportion of the activations in the hidden layers to zero at each iteration. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single feature, encouraging more robust representations.

## Early Stopping

Early stopping is a technique where the training process is halted when the performance on a validation set stops improving or begins to degrade. This prevents the model from overfitting the training data by stopping the training before the model becomes too complex.

## Batch Normalization

Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning models to improve training stability and reduce the need for other regularization techniques. It normalizes the activations within each mini-batch during training, reducing the internal covariate shift and allowing for higher learning rates.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can include rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping of images in computer vision tasks or adding noise to audio data in speech recognition tasks. Data augmentation encourages the model to learn more robust features and reduces the risk of overfitting.
