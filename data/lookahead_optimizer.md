# Lookahead Optimizer

The Lookahead optimizer is a recent optimization algorithm that aims to improve the performance of existing optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum optimizer, and Adam optimizer. It was introduced by Michael Zhang, James Lucas, Jimmy Ba, and Geoffrey Hinton in their paper "Lookahead Optimizer: k steps forward, 1 step back".

## How it Works

The Lookahead optimizer combines two optimization algorithms, a fast optimizer and a slow optimizer. The fast optimizer, which can be any existing optimization algorithm like SGD or Adam, is used for updating the model parameters during training. The slow optimizer, which is a modified version of the fast optimizer, is used to update the weights of a "slow" model.

The slow model is a copy of the original model, and its weights are updated using the slow optimizer. The slow optimizer takes larger steps than the fast optimizer, but it updates the weights less frequently. Specifically, it updates the weights of the slow model once every k steps, where k is a hyperparameter.

During training, the fast optimizer updates the weights of the original model using the gradients computed from the current minibatch. After k steps, the weights of the slow model are updated using the slow optimizer. Then, the weights of the original model are updated by taking a step towards the weights of the slow model. This step is called the "lookahead" step, as it involves looking ahead to the weights of the slow model.

The lookahead step is calculated as follows:

$$\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k + \alpha(\theta_s - \theta_k)$$

where $\theta_k$ is the current weights of the original model, $\theta_s$ is the weights of the slow model, $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter that controls the step size, and $\theta_{k+1}$ is the updated weights of the original model.

## Advantages

The Lookahead optimizer has several advantages over existing optimization algorithms:

- Improved Generalization: By using the slow model to update the weights, the Lookahead optimizer can escape from sharp minima and find flatter minima, which can improve the generalization performance of the model.

- Faster Convergence: The Lookahead optimizer can converge faster than existing optimization algorithms, as it can reduce the effect of noisy gradients and find better weight updates.

- Easy to Implement: The Lookahead optimizer is easy to implement, as it can be used with any existing optimization algorithm.
