# Compressed Sensing

Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique used to efficiently acquire and reconstruct sparse or compressible signals from a limited number of measurements. It is also known as compressive sensing or sparse sampling. CS has significant applications in image processing, medical imaging, radar and sonar imaging, and wireless communications.

CS theory is based on the principle that many natural signals, such as images or sound, are sparse or compressible in some transform domain. For example, a natural image can be represented as a sparse linear combination of a few basis functions, such as wavelets or Fourier coefficients. Therefore, instead of directly acquiring the entire signal, CS acquires a small number of linear projections of the signal, which can be efficiently reconstructed into an approximation of the original signal.

The CS reconstruction process involves solving an optimization problem that minimizes the l1-norm of the signal subject to the measurement constraints. This problem can be formulated as:

$$\hat{x} = \arg\min_{z} \|z\|_1 \text{ subject to } y = \Phi z$$

where $\hat{x}$ is the estimated signal, $z$ is the sparse representation of the signal, $y$ is the measurement vector, and $\Phi$ is the sensing matrix that defines the linear projections. This problem can be efficiently solved using convex optimization algorithms, such as basis pursuit, iterative shrinkage and thresholding (IST), or compressed sensing matching pursuit (CoSaMP).

CS has numerous advantages over traditional signal processing techniques, such as faster acquisition times, reduced storage requirements, and improved signal-to-noise ratio. However, CS also has some limitations, such as the requirement of prior knowledge about the sparsity or compressibility of the signal, the sensitivity to measurement noise and errors, and the need for accurate calibration of the sensing matrix. Therefore, CS is often used in conjunction with other signal processing techniques, such as sparse coding, dictionary learning, or random matrix theory.
