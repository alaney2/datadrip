# Stochastic Processes

A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a system over time, where the system is subject to random fluctuations. Stochastic processes are used in various fields, including physics, finance, engineering, and computer science. In AI, ML, and DL, stochastic processes are widely used for modeling uncertainty and making predictions.

## Probability Theory

Probability theory is the foundation of stochastic processes. It deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence. A good understanding of probability theory is essential for understanding stochastic processes.

## Random Variables

Random variables are variables that take on different values according to the outcome of a random event. They are used to model the uncertainty in a system. A stochastic process can be thought of as a collection of random variables indexed by time.

## Probability Distributions

Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event. They play a crucial role in stochastic processes as they determine the behavior of the random variables.

## Markov Chains

A Markov chain is a type of stochastic process where the future state of the system depends only on the current state and not on the past states. Markov chains are widely used in AI, ML, and DL for modeling sequential data.

## Martingales

Martingales are a type of stochastic process where the expected value of the next value in the sequence is equal to the current value, given the current information available. Martingales are used in finance and gambling for modeling fair games.

## Brownian Motion

Brownian motion is a type of stochastic process where the system undergoes random fluctuations in a continuous manner. Brownian motion is used in physics and finance for modeling the movement of particles and stock prices, respectively.

## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is the study of data that is collected over time. Stochastic processes are used in time series analysis for modeling the underlying dynamics of the data.

## Statistics

Statistics is the study of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Stochastic processes are used in statistics for modeling the uncertainty in the data.

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the study of linear equations and their properties. It is used extensively in stochastic processes for representing and manipulating matrices and vectors.
