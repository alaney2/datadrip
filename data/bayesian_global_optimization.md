# Bayesian Global Optimization

Bayesian Global Optimization (BGO) is a powerful optimization technique that is particularly well-suited for optimizing expensive black-box functions. It is based on the principles of Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes, and it is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, engineering, and finance. In this article, we will provide an overview of the main concepts and components of BGO, as well as some of its applications and extensions.

## Overview

The main goal of BGO is to find the global minimum (or maximum) of an unknown objective function $f(x)$, where $x$ is a vector of input variables. The function $f(x)$ is assumed to be expensive to evaluate, meaning that the number of evaluations should be minimized. In addition, $f(x)$ is considered a black-box function, meaning that we do not have access to its analytical form or its gradients.

To achieve this goal, BGO uses a probabilistic model to approximate the unknown function $f(x)$. This model, called a surrogate model, is used to guide the search for the global minimum by estimating the value of $f(x)$ at different points in the input space. The surrogate model is updated iteratively as new evaluations of $f(x)$ are obtained, and the search is guided by an acquisition function, which balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

## Surrogate Models

A key component of BGO is the surrogate model, which is used to approximate the unknown objective function $f(x)$. The surrogate model should be able to capture the underlying structure of $f(x)$, while being computationally efficient to evaluate and update. In BGO, Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate models due to their flexibility and ability to provide uncertainty estimates.

A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. It is fully specified by a mean function $m(x)$ and a covariance function (or kernel) $k(x, x')$. The mean function represents the expected value of the GP at each point in the input space, while the covariance function determines the correlation between the function values at different points.

Given a set of observed data points $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $y_i = f(x_i)$, the GP can be used to make predictions for the function value at a new point $x_*$. The predictive distribution of the GP is given by:


$$

p(f(x_*) | \mathcal{D}, x_*) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(x_*), \sigma^2(x_*)),

$$


where $\mu(x_*)$ and $\sigma^2(x_*)$ are the mean and variance of the predictive distribution, respectively. These quantities can be computed efficiently using the GP's mean and covariance functions, as well as the observed data points.

## Acquisition Functions

The acquisition function is another crucial component of BGO, as it guides the search for the global minimum by determining the next point to evaluate the objective function. The acquisition function balances the trade-off between exploration (searching in regions with high uncertainty) and exploitation (focusing on regions with low objective function values).

There are several popular acquisition functions used in BGO, including:

1. Probability of Improvement (PI): This acquisition function measures the probability that a new point will improve upon the current best solution. It is given by:


$$

\alpha_{\text{PI}}(x) = \Phi\left(\frac{\mu(x) - f(x_{\text{best}}) - \xi}{\sigma(x)}\right),

$$


where $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$ are the mean and standard deviation of the GP at $x$, $f(x_{\text{best}})$ is the current best function value, and $\xi$ is a small positive constant that encourages exploration.

2. Expected Improvement (EI): This acquisition function measures the expected improvement over the current best solution. It is given by:


$$

\alpha_{\text{EI}}(x) = \sigma(x) \left(\gamma(x) \Phi(\gamma(x)) + \phi(\gamma(x))\right),

$$


where $\gamma(x) = \frac{\mu(x) - f(x_{\text{best}}) - \xi}{\sigma(x)}$, $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, $\phi$ is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution, and $\xi$ is a small positive constant that encourages exploration.

3. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): This acquisition function measures the upper bound of the confidence interval around the GP's mean prediction. It is given by:


$$

\alpha_{\text{UCB}}(x) = \mu(x) + \kappa \sigma(x),

$$


where $\kappa$ is a positive constant that controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

## Applications and Extensions

Bayesian Global Optimization has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including:

1. Hyperparameter optimization in machine learning: BGO can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters of machine learning models, such as neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees.

2. Design optimization in engineering: BGO can be used to optimize the design of complex systems, such as aircraft, automobiles, and structures, by minimizing the cost or maximizing the performance.

3. Financial optimization: BGO can be used to optimize investment portfolios, trading strategies, and risk management policies.

In addition to these applications, there are several extensions of BGO that have been proposed in the literature, such as multi-objective Bayesian optimization, which aims to optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, and parallel Bayesian optimization, which leverages parallel computing resources to speed up the optimization process.

In conclusion, Bayesian Global Optimization is a powerful and flexible optimization technique that has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. Its main components, the surrogate model and the acquisition function, allow it to efficiently explore and exploit the search space, making it particularly well-suited for optimizing expensive black-box functions.
