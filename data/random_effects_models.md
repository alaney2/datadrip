# Random Effects Models

Random effects models, also known as variance components models, are a type of statistical model used to analyze data that has a hierarchical or clustered structure. These models are particularly useful when the data has a nested structure, such as students within schools, employees within companies, or repeated measurements on the same individual over time. Random effects models are a subset of mixed effects models, which combine both fixed effects (representing the average relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome) and random effects (representing the variability of the relationship across different levels of the hierarchy).

## Overview

In a random effects model, the outcome variable is modeled as a linear function of predictor variables, with the addition of random effects that represent the variability of the relationship across different levels of the hierarchy. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance that is estimated from the data. The inclusion of random effects allows the model to account for the correlation between observations within the same cluster, as well as the heterogeneity of the relationship across different clusters.

The general form of a random effects model is:


$$

y_{ij} = X_{ij}\beta + Z_{ij}u_j + \epsilon_{ij}

$$


where $y_{ij}$ is the outcome variable for the $i$-th observation in the $j$-th cluster, $X_{ij}$ is a vector of predictor variables, $\beta$ is a vector of fixed effects coefficients, $Z_{ij}$ is a vector of random effects predictors, $u_j$ is a vector of random effects for the $j$-th cluster, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the error term for the $i$-th observation in the $j$-th cluster.

The random effects $u_j$ are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a covariance matrix $G$:


$$

u_j \sim N(0, G)

$$


The error terms $\epsilon_{ij}$ are also assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance $\sigma^2$:


$$

\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)

$$


## Estimation

The parameters of a random effects model, including the fixed effects coefficients $\beta$, the covariance matrix $G$, and the error variance $\sigma^2$, can be estimated using various methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation, restricted maximum likelihood estimation, or Bayesian estimation.

Maximum likelihood estimation involves finding the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data, given the model. In the case of a random effects model, this involves maximizing the likelihood of the observed outcome variable $y_{ij}$, given the predictor variables $X_{ij}$ and $Z_{ij}$, and the model parameters $\beta$, $G$, and $\sigma^2$. The likelihood function for a random effects model can be written as:


$$

L(\beta, G, \sigma^2 | y, X, Z) = \prod_{j=1}^J \int f(y_j | X_j, Z_j, u_j) f(u_j | G) du_j

$$


where $f(y_j | X_j, Z_j, u_j)$ is the conditional density of the outcome variable $y_j$ given the predictor variables $X_j$, $Z_j$, and the random effects $u_j$, and $f(u_j | G)$ is the density of the random effects given the covariance matrix $G$.

Restricted maximum likelihood estimation is an alternative method that is often preferred in practice, as it provides unbiased estimates of the variance components $G$ and $\sigma^2$. This method involves maximizing the likelihood of the data after removing the fixed effects, which can be achieved by integrating out the fixed effects from the likelihood function:


$$

L_R(G, \sigma^2 | y, X, Z) = \int L(\beta, G, \sigma^2 | y, X, Z) d\beta

$$


Bayesian estimation involves specifying prior distributions for the model parameters and updating these priors with the observed data to obtain posterior distributions. The posterior distributions can be used to make inferences about the parameters, such as point estimates or credible intervals. In the case of a random effects model, this involves specifying prior distributions for the fixed effects coefficients $\beta$, the covariance matrix $G$, and the error variance $\sigma^2$, and updating these priors with the observed data using Bayes' theorem:


$$

p(\beta, G, \sigma^2 | y, X, Z) \propto L(\beta, G, \sigma^2 | y, X, Z) p(\beta) p(G) p(\sigma^2)

$$


where $p(\beta)$, $p(G)$, and $p(\sigma^2)$ are the prior distributions for the fixed effects coefficients, the covariance matrix, and the error variance, respectively.

## Applications

Random effects models have a wide range of applications in various fields, such as education, psychology, economics, and medicine. Some common applications include:

- Analyzing the effects of school or teacher characteristics on student achievement, while accounting for the clustering of students within schools or classrooms.
- Investigating the relationship between individual characteristics and health outcomes, while accounting for the correlation between repeated measurements on the same individual over time.
- Estimating the effects of policy interventions or treatments on outcomes of interest, while accounting for the heterogeneity of the effects across different subgroups or contexts.

## Limitations and Extensions

One limitation of random effects models is the assumption of normally distributed random effects and error terms. This assumption may not always be appropriate, and alternative models, such as generalized linear mixed models or nonparametric random effects models, can be used to relax this assumption.

Another limitation is the assumption of a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome. Extensions of random effects models, such as nonlinear mixed effects models or functional mixed effects models, can be used to model more complex relationships.

Finally, random effects models assume that the random effects are independent of the predictor variables. This assumption may not always hold, and alternative models, such as correlated random effects models or endogenous random effects models, can be used to account for the correlation between the random effects and the predictor variables.
