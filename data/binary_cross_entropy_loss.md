# Binary Cross Entropy Loss

Binary Cross Entropy Loss, also known as Binary Log Loss or Sigmoid Cross Entropy Loss, is a loss function used in binary classification tasks in machine learning and deep learning. It measures the difference between two probability distributions, typically the true distribution (ground truth) and the predicted distribution (model output). Binary Cross Entropy Loss is commonly used in logistic regression and neural networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.

## Definition

Given a dataset of $N$ samples, where each sample has a true label $y_i$ and a predicted probability $\hat{y}_i$, the Binary Cross Entropy Loss is defined as:


$$

L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]

$$


Here, $y_i$ is either 0 or 1, representing the true class label, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability of the positive class (class 1) for the $i$-th sample. The loss function penalizes the model more when the predicted probability is far from the true label.

## Properties

1. **Non-negative**: The Binary Cross Entropy Loss is always non-negative, as the logarithm of a probability (between 0 and 1) is always negative, and the loss function involves negating the sum of these logarithms.

2. **Minimum value**: The loss function achieves its minimum value of 0 when the predicted probabilities match the true labels exactly. In other words, when $\hat{y}_i = y_i$ for all $i$, the loss function is 0.

3. **Convexity**: The Binary Cross Entropy Loss is a convex function, which makes it suitable for optimization using gradient-based methods, such as gradient descent and its variants.

## Relationship with Cross Entropy

Binary Cross Entropy Loss is a special case of the more general Cross Entropy Loss, which is used for multi-class classification problems. In the multi-class case, the true labels are represented as one-hot encoded vectors, and the predicted probabilities are obtained using a softmax activation function in the output layer of the model. The Cross Entropy Loss is then computed as the average negative log-likelihood of the true labels given the predicted probabilities.

When there are only two classes, the one-hot encoded true labels reduce to scalar values (0 or 1), and the softmax activation function can be replaced with a sigmoid activation function. In this case, the Cross Entropy Loss reduces to the Binary Cross Entropy Loss.

## Applications

Binary Cross Entropy Loss is widely used in various binary classification tasks, such as:

1. **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is a linear model for binary classification that uses the sigmoid function to produce predicted probabilities. The model is trained by minimizing the Binary Cross Entropy Loss with respect to the model parameters.

2. **Neural Networks**: In deep learning, neural networks with a single output neuron and a sigmoid activation function can be used for binary classification. The Binary Cross Entropy Loss is used as the objective function during training.

3. **Image Segmentation**: In image segmentation tasks, each pixel is classified as belonging to one of two classes (foreground or background). Binary Cross Entropy Loss can be used to train models for such tasks, where the ground truth and predicted probabilities are represented as 2D arrays.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: In anomaly detection tasks, data points are classified as either normal or anomalous. Binary Cross Entropy Loss can be used to train models that predict the probability of a data point being anomalous.

## Conclusion

Binary Cross Entropy Loss is an important loss function in machine learning and deep learning for binary classification tasks. It measures the difference between the true labels and the predicted probabilities, and its properties make it suitable for optimization using gradient-based methods. It is widely used in logistic regression, neural networks, image segmentation, and anomaly detection tasks.
