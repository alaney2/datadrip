# Model Based RL in Real World

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that involves learning a model of the environment and using it to make decisions. Model-based RL is particularly useful in real-world applications where the environment is complex and the agent must make decisions in real-time. In this article, we will discuss the concept of model-based RL in real-world applications.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning to make decisions based on feedback from the environment. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and receives rewards or punishments based on its actions. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative reward over time.

## Model-Based Methods

Model-based methods in reinforcement learning involve learning a model of the environment and using it to make decisions. The model can be used to simulate the environment and predict the outcomes of different actions. Model-based methods are particularly useful in real-world applications where the environment is complex and the agent must make decisions in real-time.

## Dynamics Models

Dynamics models are models of the environment that predict the outcomes of different actions. Dynamics models can be learned from data or designed by domain experts. In model-based RL, the agent uses the dynamics model to simulate the environment and predict the outcomes of different actions.

## Real-World Applications

Model-based RL has been successfully applied to a variety of real-world applications, including robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. In robotics, model-based RL can be used to learn a model of the robot's environment and use it to plan trajectories. In autonomous driving, model-based RL can be used to learn a model of the road and use it to plan safe and efficient routes. In game playing, model-based RL can be used to learn a model of the game and use it to make optimal moves.

## Conclusion

Model-based RL is a powerful approach to reinforcement learning that involves learning a model of the environment and using it to make decisions. Model-based RL is particularly useful in real-world applications where the environment is complex and the agent must make decisions in real-time. By learning a model of the environment, the agent can simulate the environment and predict the outcomes of different actions, leading to more efficient and effective decision-making.
