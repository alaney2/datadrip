# Decentralized Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

Decentralized Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that focuses on learning policies for multiple agents that interact with each other in a decentralized manner. In this setting, each agent has its own local observation and action space, and the agents must learn to coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal.

## Decentralized Control

Decentralized control is a control strategy where each agent makes decisions based only on its own local information, without any centralized coordination. In the context of MARL, decentralized control means that each agent learns its own policy based only on its own observations, without any explicit communication or coordination with other agents.

## Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is the study of RL algorithms that can learn policies for multiple agents that interact with each other. In MARL, each agent learns its own policy based on its own observations and rewards, and the agents must learn to coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal.

## Game Theory in Multi Agent Systems

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. In the context of MARL, game theory can be used to model the interactions between agents and to analyze the properties of different coordination strategies.

## Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are systems that consist of multiple autonomous components that communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal. In the context of MARL, the agents can be seen as autonomous components of a distributed system, and the coordination between the agents can be seen as a distributed coordination problem.

## Conclusion

Decentralized Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning is an important subfield of Reinforcement Learning that focuses on learning policies for multiple agents that interact with each other in a decentralized manner. It is a challenging problem that requires the agents to learn to coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal, without any explicit communication or coordination. Game theory and distributed systems are important tools for analyzing and solving these problems.
