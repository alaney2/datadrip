# Semi Supervised Clustering

Semi-supervised clustering is a type of clustering that combines the benefits of both supervised and unsupervised learning. In a semi-supervised clustering problem, a subset of the data points is labeled while the remaining majority is unlabeled. 

The main goal of semi-supervised clustering is to leverage the limited labeled data to improve the clustering performance. This is particularly useful in scenarios where labeling data is expensive or time-consuming and where unlabeled data is abundant. 

## Algorithms

There are many algorithms for semi-supervised clustering. Some of the most popular ones include:

- **Self-Training**: This algorithm works by first clustering the labeled data and then using those labels to infer the labels of the unlabeled data. The inferred labels are then used to retrain the model iteratively until convergence.

- **Co-Training**: This algorithm works by dividing the feature space into two or more views and training separate models on each view. The models are then used to label the unlabeled data, and the most confident predictions are added to the labeled set for retraining the models.

- **Spectral Clustering**: This algorithm works by first building a graph from the data points and then clustering the graph. The graph is constructed using the similarity between data points, and the clustering is performed using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian.

## Applications

Semi-supervised clustering has many applications, including:

- **Text Classification**: In text classification, semi-supervised clustering can be used to classify documents into different categories based on a small set of labeled documents and a large set of unlabeled documents.

- **Image Segmentation**: In image segmentation, semi-supervised clustering can be used to group pixels in an image into different regions based on their similarity.

- **Anomaly Detection**: In anomaly detection, semi-supervised clustering can be used to identify unusual patterns in data by clustering the normal data and using the resulting model to detect deviations from the normal pattern.

## Conclusion

Semi-supervised clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the clustering performance when labeled data is limited. There are many algorithms for semi-supervised clustering, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Semi-supervised clustering has many applications in different fields, including text classification, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.
