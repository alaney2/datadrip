# Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes

Online learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is a subfield of reinforcement learning that deals with learning optimal policies in an online setting. In this setting, an agent interacts with an environment and learns from the feedback it receives in real-time. The agent's goal is to maximize its cumulative reward over time.

## Markov Decision Processes

Markov decision processes are mathematical models used to describe decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. They consist of a set of states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. At each time step, the agent observes the current state of the environment, selects an action, and receives a reward. The next state of the environment is then determined by the transition probabilities.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning from feedback in an interactive environment. In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to take actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal. The agent's goal is to learn an optimal policy that maps states to actions.

## Online Learning

Online learning is a type of machine learning where the learning algorithm receives data in a sequential order and updates its model as it receives new data. In online learning, the model is updated after each data point is received, rather than waiting for all the data to be collected before updating the model.

## Stochastic Approximation

Stochastic approximation is a method used in online learning to update the model parameters based on noisy feedback. In stochastic approximation, the model parameters are updated using a noisy estimate of the gradient of the loss function.

## Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal difference learning is a method used in reinforcement learning to update the value function based on the difference between the estimated value of the current state and the estimated value of the next state. Temporal difference learning is a type of online learning because the value function is updated after each time step.

## Q-Learning

Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an optimal policy by estimating the value of each state-action pair. Q-learning is a type of online learning because the Q-values are updated after each time step.

In summary, online learning in Markov decision processes is a subfield of reinforcement learning that deals with learning optimal policies in an online setting. It involves using stochastic approximation, temporal difference learning, and Q-learning to update the model parameters and estimate the optimal policy.
