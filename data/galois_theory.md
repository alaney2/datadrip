# Galois Theory

Galois Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationship between field extensions and groups. It was developed by Ã‰variste Galois in the early 19th century and has since become an important tool in a variety of fields, including algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and cryptography.

## Field Theory

Before diving into Galois Theory, one must have a solid understanding of field theory. A field is defined as a set of elements with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain axioms. Field theory studies the properties of fields and their extensions.

## Group Theory

Group theory is another important prerequisite for Galois Theory. A group is a set with an operation that satisfies certain axioms. Group theory studies the properties of groups and their subgroups.

## Galois Theory From Start to End

*Galois Theory From Start to End* by Ian Stewart is a comprehensive introduction to Galois Theory. It covers the fundamental concepts and theorems of the subject, including Galois groups, normal extensions, and solvability by radicals.

## Algebraic Number Theory

Algebraic Number Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies number fields, which are extensions of the field of rational numbers. Galois Theory is an important tool in Algebraic Number Theory, particularly in the study of class field theory.

## Abstract Algebra

Abstract Algebra is the study of algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and fields. It provides the necessary framework for the study of Galois Theory.

In conclusion, Galois Theory is a fascinating and important branch of mathematics that has applications in a wide range of fields. A strong foundation in field theory and group theory is essential for understanding the subject, and further study in Algebraic Number Theory and Abstract Algebra can deepen one's understanding of its applications.
