# Cutout Augmentation

Cutout Augmentation is a data augmentation technique used in computer vision tasks to improve the robustness of deep learning models. It is specifically used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is a popular technique to prevent overfitting in the model.

## Technique

Cutout Augmentation involves randomly removing a square patch of pixels from an image during training. The patch is selected randomly with a fixed size, and the pixels inside the patch are replaced with zero values. This technique helps the model to learn the important features of the image by forcing it to focus on the other parts of the image.

## Benefits

Cutout Augmentation has the following benefits:

- Prevents overfitting: Cutout Augmentation improves the generalization ability of the model by preventing overfitting.
- Increases robustness: By removing a part of the image, the model learns to be robust to occlusions.
- Computational efficiency: It is a computationally efficient technique, which can be used on large datasets without increasing the training time significantly.

## Implementation

Cutout Augmentation can be easily implemented with the help of libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. In PyTorch, the `Cutout` function is provided in the `transforms` module, which can be used to apply Cutout Augmentation to the input image.

```python
from torchvision.transforms import transforms
from cutout import Cutout

transform_train = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    Cutout(n_holes=1, length=16),
])
```

- Adversarial Training: a technique that improves the robustness of deep learning models by adding adversarial examples to the training data.
