# Denoising Autoencoder

A **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)** is a type of neural network that is trained to remove noise from corrupt input data by reconstructing the original, clean input. It is a variant of the traditional Autoencoder, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a compressed representation of input data. The key difference between a DAE and a traditional Autoencoder is that the former is trained to denoise input data by adding noise to it and reconstructing the original input.

## Structure and Working

The structure of a DAE is similar to that of a traditional Autoencoder, with an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network compresses the input data into a latent space representation, which is then passed to the decoder network for reconstruction. However, in the case of a DAE, the input data is first corrupted with some form of noise, such as Gaussian noise or salt-and-pepper noise, before being passed through the encoder network. The decoder network then tries to reconstruct the original, clean input from the noisy input.

Training a DAE involves minimizing a reconstruction loss function, such as the mean squared error (MSE) or binary cross-entropy, between the reconstructed output and the original input. This encourages the network to learn a compressed representation of the input that can effectively remove noise and reconstruct the original input.

## Applications

DAEs have a variety of applications in image and audio processing, where they are used for denoising noisy images and audio signals. They can also be used for data compression and feature extraction, where the compressed latent space representation can be used as input to other machine learning algorithms.
