# Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning With Communication

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that deals with multiple agents learning to interact with each other and their environment. Communication between agents is an important aspect of MARL, as it allows agents to share information and coordinate their actions. 

In MARL with communication, agents are able to send messages to each other during the learning process. This allows them to share information about the environment, their own state, and the actions they plan to take. Communication can be either explicit or implicit, and can take many forms, such as sending messages through a shared channel or using a learned communication protocol.

MARL with communication has many applications, such as in robotics, where multiple robots need to work together to complete a task, or in game theory, where multiple players need to coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal. 

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with agents learning to interact with an environment in order to maximize a reward signal. In RL, an agent takes actions in an environment and receives feedback in the form of a reward signal. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

## Multi Agent Systems

Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is a field of study that deals with systems composed of multiple interacting agents. MAS can be found in many domains, such as robotics, economics, and social sciences. In MAS, agents can have different goals and behaviors, and can interact with each other in various ways.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with neural networks with many layers. Deep Learning has been used in many applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. Deep Learning has also been used in RL, where neural networks are used to represent the agent's policy or value function.

## Actor Critic Methods

Actor Critic Methods are a class of RL algorithms that use two neural networks, one to represent the policy (the actor) and one to represent the value function (the critic). Actor Critic Methods have been used in MARL to learn policies for multiple agents.

## Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient Methods are a class of RL algorithms that directly optimize the policy of an agent. Policy Gradient Methods have been used in MARL to learn policies for multiple agents.
