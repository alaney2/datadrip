# Differential Evolution

Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based optimization algorithm that belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms. It was introduced by Rainer Storn and Kenneth Price in 1995 as a simple and efficient method for solving complex optimization problems. DE is particularly well-suited for solving continuous, non-linear, and multimodal optimization problems.

## Overview

Differential Evolution operates on a population of candidate solutions, which are represented as real-valued vectors. The algorithm iteratively improves the quality of the solutions by applying mutation, crossover, and selection operators. The main idea behind DE is to generate new candidate solutions by combining the differences of randomly selected individuals from the population.

The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Initialize the population with random candidate solutions.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
3. For each individual in the population, perform the following operations:
   1. Mutation: Generate a mutant vector by combining the differences of randomly selected individuals.
   2. Crossover: Create a trial vector by mixing the components of the mutant vector and the target individual.
   3. Selection: Compare the fitness of the trial vector and the target individual, and replace the target individual with the trial vector if the trial vector has better fitness.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a termination criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a desired fitness level.

## Mutation

The mutation operation in Differential Evolution generates a mutant vector by combining the differences of randomly selected individuals from the population. The most common mutation strategy is called DE/rand/1, which can be described as follows:

1. Randomly select three distinct individuals from the population: $x_{r1}$, $x_{r2}$, and $x_{r3}$.
2. Calculate the mutant vector $v$ as follows:


$$

v = x_{r1} + F \cdot (x_{r2} - x_{r3})

$$


where $F$ is a scaling factor that controls the amplification of the differences between the selected individuals. The value of $F$ is typically chosen between 0 and 2.

## Crossover

The crossover operation in Differential Evolution combines the components of the mutant vector and the target individual to create a trial vector. The most common crossover strategy is called binomial crossover, which can be described as follows:

1. For each component $i$ of the target individual $x$ and the mutant vector $v$, generate a random number $r_i$ uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
2. If $r_i$ is less than a crossover probability $CR$ or $i$ is equal to a randomly chosen index $j$, set the corresponding component of the trial vector $u$ to the component of the mutant vector $v_i$:


$$

u_i = \begin{cases}
v_i, & \text{if } r_i < CR \text{ or } i = j \\
x_i, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

$$


The crossover probability $CR$ is a parameter that controls the degree of mixing between the target individual and the mutant vector. It is typically chosen between 0 and 1.

## Selection

The selection operation in Differential Evolution compares the fitness of the trial vector and the target individual and replaces the target individual with the trial vector if the trial vector has better fitness. The selection process can be described as follows:

1. Evaluate the fitness of the trial vector $u$.
2. If the fitness of the trial vector is better than the fitness of the target individual $x$, replace the target individual with the trial vector:


$$

x = \begin{cases}
u, & \text{if } f(u) < f(x) \\
x, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

$$


where $f(u)$ and $f(x)$ are the fitness values of the trial vector and the target individual, respectively.

## Variants and Extensions

Several variants and extensions of Differential Evolution have been proposed to improve its performance and adapt it to different problem domains. Some of these variants include:

- Adaptive control of the scaling factor $F$ and the crossover probability $CR$.
- Different mutation strategies, such as DE/best/1, DE/rand/2, and DE/best/2.
- Constraint handling techniques for solving constrained optimization problems.
- Hybridization with other optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms.

## Applications

Differential Evolution has been successfully applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including:

- Function optimization, including benchmark functions and real-world problems.
- Parameter estimation and model fitting in various fields, such as physics, chemistry, and biology.
- Machine learning and data mining tasks, such as feature selection, clustering, and classification.
- Engineering design and optimization, including structural design, control systems, and power systems.
