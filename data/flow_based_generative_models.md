# Flow Based Generative Models

Flow-Based Generative Models are a class of generative models that are designed to learn the probability distribution of a given dataset and generate new samples from it. These models represent the probability distribution as a flow of transformations from a simple base distribution, such as a standard normal distribution. The transformations are invertible, which allows for exact likelihood computation and efficient sampling.

The flow-based generative models have gained popularity due to their ability to generate high-quality samples and their tractability for inference and likelihood computation. This property makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including image and speech generation, anomaly detection, and density estimation.

## Variational Autoencoders

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that learns to encode a given dataset into a latent space and generate new samples from it. VAEs are trained by maximizing the lower bound of the log-likelihood of the data given the model. VAEs have been used to generate high-quality images, but they suffer from posterior collapse, where the model ignores the latent variable during generation.

## Normalizing Flows

Normalizing Flows are a class of models that transform a base distribution into a more complex distribution using a series of invertible transformations. The invertibility of the transformations allows for exact likelihood computation and efficient sampling. Normalizing flows have been used to generate high-quality images, but they are computationally expensive, and the number of transformations limits the complexity of the model.

## Autoregressive Models

Autoregressive Models are a class of generative models that generate a sequence of outputs by conditioning on the previous outputs. Autoregressive models have been used to generate high-quality text, but they suffer from slow generation and are not appropriate for modeling complex multi-modal distributions.

## Invertible Autoencoders

Invertible Autoencoders are a type of generative model that learns to encode a given dataset into a latent space and generate new samples from it. Invertible Autoencoders are trained by minimizing the reconstruction loss and maximizing the likelihood of the data given the model. Invertible Autoencoders are computationally efficient, but they are not suitable for modeling complex multi-modal distributions.

## Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative model that learns to generate new samples by training a generator network to fool a discriminator network. GANs have been used to generate high-quality images, but they suffer from mode collapse, where the generator network generates a limited set of samples.

Flow-Based Generative Models are a promising research area in the field of deep learning, and they have shown promising results in generating high-quality samples and modeling complex distributions. However, they still suffer from some limitations, such as computational complexity and the ability to model complex multi-modal distributions.
