# Importance Weighted Autoencoder

Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) is a deep learning-based method for anomaly detection that extends the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework. IWAE improves the VAE's ability to model complex data distributions by incorporating importance sampling, a technique from Monte Carlo methods, into the training process. This results in a more expressive and accurate generative model, which can be used to detect anomalies in high-dimensional data.

## Background

Anomaly detection is the task of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. In many real-world applications, such as fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and medical diagnosis, detecting anomalous patterns is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of negative consequences.

Deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have gained popularity due to their ability to learn complex patterns in high-dimensional data. Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders are two popular deep learning models used for anomaly detection. Autoencoders learn to reconstruct input data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding it back to the original space. Variational Autoencoders extend this framework by learning a probabilistic mapping between the input data and the latent space, allowing for a more robust representation of the data distribution.

## Importance Weighted Autoencoder

The Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) was introduced by Burda et al. in 2015 as an extension of the VAE framework. The key idea behind IWAE is to incorporate importance sampling into the training process, which allows for a tighter approximation of the true data distribution. This results in a more expressive generative model, which can better capture the structure of the data and detect anomalies more accurately.

The IWAE consists of an encoder network, a decoder network, and a latent variable model. The encoder network maps the input data to a distribution over the latent space, while the decoder network maps the latent variables back to the data space. The latent variable model is a prior distribution over the latent space, typically chosen to be a simple distribution such as a Gaussian.

The training objective of the IWAE is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data under the generative model. The ELBO can be written as:


$$

\text{ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}\left[\log p(x|z)\right] - \text{KL}\left[q(z|x) || p(z)\right],

$$


where $q(z|x)$ is the encoder network's output distribution, $p(x|z)$ is the decoder network's output distribution, and $p(z)$ is the prior distribution over the latent space. The first term in the ELBO measures the reconstruction quality of the autoencoder, while the second term measures the divergence between the encoder's output distribution and the prior distribution.

In the IWAE, importance sampling is used to approximate the ELBO more accurately. The importance-weighted ELBO is defined as:


$$

\text{IW-ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z_1|x), \dots, q(z_K|x)}\left[\log \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{p(x, z_k)}{q(z_k|x)}\right],

$$


where $K$ is the number of importance samples, and $z_k$ are samples drawn from the encoder's output distribution. The IW-ELBO is a tighter lower bound on the log-likelihood than the standard ELBO, which means that optimizing the IW-ELBO leads to a better approximation of the true data distribution.

During training, the IWAE optimizes the IW-ELBO using stochastic gradient descent and the reparameterization trick, which allows for efficient backpropagation through the sampling process. Once trained, the IWAE can be used for anomaly detection by computing the reconstruction error between the input data and the decoded output. Data points with high reconstruction error are considered anomalous, as they deviate significantly from the majority of the data.

## Advantages and Limitations

The Importance Weighted Autoencoder has several advantages over standard autoencoders and variational autoencoders for anomaly detection:

1. Improved expressiveness: The IWAE's incorporation of importance sampling allows for a tighter approximation of the true data distribution, resulting in a more expressive generative model.
2. Robustness to overfitting: The IWAE's probabilistic framework and regularization term in the training objective help prevent overfitting, making it more robust to noise and outliers in the data.
3. Scalability: The IWAE can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and the reparameterization trick, making it suitable for large-scale, high-dimensional data.

However, the IWAE also has some limitations:

1. Complexity: The IWAE's training process is more complex than that of standard autoencoders and VAEs, which may make it more difficult to implement and tune.
2. Computational cost: The use of importance sampling increases the computational cost of the IWAE, especially when using a large number of importance samples.

Despite these limitations, the Importance Weighted Autoencoder has shown promising results in various anomaly detection tasks and remains an active area of research in deep learning-based anomaly detection.
