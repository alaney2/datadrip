# Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning In Social Dilemmas

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that deals with the problem of multiple agents learning and interacting with each other in a shared environment. Social dilemmas are a class of problems in MARL where the agents' individual goals conflict with the collective goals of the group. 

In social dilemmas, agents must balance their own self-interest with the interest of the group. This creates a tension between cooperation and competition, which makes it challenging to design effective learning algorithms. 

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that deals with the problem of learning from experience. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes its cumulative reward over time. 

## Multi Agent Systems

Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the problem of designing systems that consist of multiple autonomous agents. In MAS, agents can have different goals, beliefs, and capabilities, which makes it challenging to coordinate their actions. 

## Game Theory

Game Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of strategic interactions between agents. In game theory, agents are assumed to be rational and make decisions based on their beliefs and preferences. Game theory provides a framework for analyzing social dilemmas and designing strategies that promote cooperation. 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of RL that deals with the problem of learning policies using deep neural networks. DRL has been successful in solving complex problems such as playing Atari games and Go. 

## Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of RL that deals with the problem of learning in multi-agent environments. In MARL, agents can have different goals and interact with each other in a shared environment. MARL requires the agents to learn policies that are robust to the actions of other agents. 

## Social Dilemmas in AI

Social Dilemmas are a class of problems in AI where the agents' individual goals conflict with the collective goals of the group. Social dilemmas arise in many real-world scenarios such as traffic congestion, resource allocation, and climate change. Social dilemmas require the agents to balance their own self-interest with the interest of the group. 

## Conclusion

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in Social Dilemmas is a challenging problem in AI that requires the agents to balance their own self-interest with the interest of the group. MARL provides a framework for designing learning algorithms that can handle the complexity of multi-agent environments. Game theory provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing social dilemmas and designing strategies that promote cooperation. DRL provides a powerful tool for learning policies in complex environments.
