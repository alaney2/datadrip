# Viterbi Algorithm

The Viterbi Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states, called the Viterbi path, in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). It was developed by Andrew Viterbi in 1967 and has since been widely used in various applications, such as speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and bioinformatics.

## Hidden Markov Models

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents a system that transitions between a finite set of hidden states over time. In an HMM, the state is not directly observable, but the output, which depends on the state, is observable. The model consists of the following components:

1. A set of hidden states, $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_N\}$.
2. A set of observable outputs, $O = \{o_1, o_2, ..., o_M\}$.
3. A state transition probability matrix, $A = \{a_{ij}\}$, where $a_{ij} = P(s_j | s_i)$, the probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.
4. An observation probability matrix, $B = \{b_{ij}\}$, where $b_{ij} = P(o_j | s_i)$, the probability of observing output $o_j$ given state $s_i$.
5. An initial state probability distribution, $\pi = \{\pi_i\}$, where $\pi_i = P(s_i)$, the probability of starting in state $s_i$.

The goal of the Viterbi Algorithm is to find the most likely sequence of hidden states, given a sequence of observed outputs.

## Algorithm

The Viterbi Algorithm is based on dynamic programming and uses a trellis structure to store intermediate results. The trellis has $N$ rows, one for each hidden state, and $T$ columns, one for each time step in the observed sequence. Each cell in the trellis, $v_{it}$, represents the probability of the most likely path that ends in state $i$ at time $t$.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Initialization: For each state $i$, compute the initial probability of being in state $i$ and observing the first output, $o_1$:

   
$$
v_{i1} = \pi_i \cdot b_{i1}
$$


2. Recursion: For each subsequent time step $t = 2, ..., T$, and for each state $i$, compute the probability of the most likely path that ends in state $i$ at time $t$:

   
$$
v_{it} = \max_{j=1}^N (v_{j(t-1)} \cdot a_{ji}) \cdot b_{it}
$$


   Also, store the index of the state that maximizes the probability:

   
$$
\text{argmax}_{j=1}^N (v_{j(t-1)} \cdot a_{ji})
$$


3. Termination: Find the state with the highest probability at the final time step, $T$:

   
$$
s_T^* = \text{argmax}_{i=1}^N v_{iT}
$$


4. Backtracking: Starting from the final state $s_T^*$, trace back the most likely path by following the stored indices:

   
$$
s_{t-1}^* = \text{argmax}_{j=1}^N (v_{j(t-1)} \cdot a_{ji})
$$


The Viterbi path is the sequence of hidden states, $s_1^*, s_2^*, ..., s_T^*$, that maximizes the probability of the observed output sequence.

## Complexity

The time complexity of the Viterbi Algorithm is $O(N^2T)$, as there are $N^2$ possible state transitions at each of the $T$ time steps. The space complexity is $O(NT)$, as the trellis requires $NT$ cells to store the intermediate probabilities.

## Applications

The Viterbi Algorithm has been widely used in various applications, including:

1. Speech recognition: In this context, the hidden states represent phonemes or words, and the observed outputs represent acoustic features extracted from the speech signal. The Viterbi Algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of phonemes or words given the acoustic features.

2. Part-of-speech tagging: In natural language processing, part-of-speech tagging is the task of assigning a grammatical category (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence. The hidden states represent the grammatical categories, and the observed outputs represent the words. The Viterbi Algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of grammatical categories given the words in a sentence.

3. Bioinformatics: In gene prediction and protein sequence alignment, the hidden states represent different regions of a DNA or protein sequence, and the observed outputs represent the nucleotides or amino acids. The Viterbi Algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of regions given the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids.

## Conclusion

The Viterbi Algorithm is a powerful and efficient method for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model. Its dynamic programming approach allows it to efficiently compute the Viterbi path in a wide range of applications, making it a fundamental tool in fields such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
