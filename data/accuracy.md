# Accuracy

Accuracy is a popular evaluation metric used in machine learning, particularly for classification problems. It measures the proportion of correct predictions made by a model out of the total number of predictions. In other words, accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.

## Definition

Mathematically, accuracy can be defined as follows:


$$

\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}

$$


In the context of binary classification, where there are two possible classes (positive and negative), accuracy can also be defined in terms of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN):


$$

\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}

$$


## Interpretation

Accuracy is a simple and intuitive metric that is easy to understand. A higher accuracy value indicates that the model is performing better at making correct predictions. However, accuracy can be misleading in certain situations, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In such cases, a model may achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class, even though it may not be performing well for the minority class. This is why it is important to consider other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, in addition to accuracy when assessing the performance of a classification model.

## Limitations

As mentioned earlier, accuracy can be misleading in cases of imbalanced datasets. For example, consider a dataset with 95% negative examples and 5% positive examples. A model that always predicts the negative class would achieve an accuracy of 95%, even though it is not making any useful predictions for the positive class. In such cases, other evaluation metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score may provide a better assessment of the model's performance.

Another limitation of accuracy is that it does not take into account the costs associated with different types of errors. In some applications, false positives and false negatives may have different consequences, and it may be more important to minimize one type of error over the other. In such cases, accuracy may not be the most appropriate evaluation metric, and other metrics like precision, recall, or a custom cost function may be more suitable.

## Example

Consider a binary classification problem where a model has made the following predictions:

- True Positives (TP): 50
- True Negatives (TN): 40
- False Positives (FP): 10
- False Negatives (FN): 20

The accuracy of the model can be calculated as follows:


$$

\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}} = \frac{50 + 40}{50 + 40 + 10 + 20} = \frac{90}{120} = 0.75

$$


The accuracy of the model is 0.75, or 75%, which means that the model made correct predictions for 75% of the instances in the dataset.

## Conclusion

Accuracy is a widely used evaluation metric for classification problems in machine learning. It is simple to calculate and easy to understand, making it a popular choice for assessing the performance of models. However, accuracy has its limitations, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when different types of errors have different costs. In such cases, it is important to consider other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of a model's performance.
