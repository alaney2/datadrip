# Bayesian Poisson Regression

Bayesian Poisson Regression is a statistical modeling technique that combines the principles of Bayesian inference with Poisson regression, a type of generalized linear model (GLM) for count data. This approach allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the model parameters and provides a full posterior distribution over the parameters, which can be used for model comparison, prediction, and uncertainty quantification.

## Poisson Regression

Poisson regression is a type of GLM used for modeling count data, where the response variable is a non-negative integer representing the number of occurrences of an event. The Poisson distribution is used as the likelihood function for the response variable, given the predictor variables. The Poisson regression model can be written as:


$$

Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)

$$


where $Y_i$ is the response variable for the $i$-th observation, and $\lambda_i$ is the expected value of the response variable, which is modeled as a function of the predictor variables:


$$

\lambda_i = \exp(\boldsymbol{X}_i \boldsymbol{\beta})

$$


Here, $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ is a row vector of predictor variables for the $i$-th observation, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a column vector of regression coefficients. The exponential function is used to ensure that the expected value $\lambda_i$ is always positive.

## Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a statistical framework that allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the model parameters. In Bayesian Poisson regression, we assign prior distributions to the regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. The prior distributions represent our beliefs about the parameters before observing the data. Common choices for the prior distributions are Gaussian or Laplace distributions, which can be used to incorporate regularization in the model.

The main goal of Bayesian inference is to compute the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the observed data. The posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior distributions:


$$

p(\boldsymbol{\beta} | \boldsymbol{Y}, \boldsymbol{X}) \propto p(\boldsymbol{Y} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) p(\boldsymbol{\beta})

$$


Here, $p(\boldsymbol{\beta} | \boldsymbol{Y}, \boldsymbol{X})$ is the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients, $p(\boldsymbol{Y} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the likelihood function (Poisson distribution), and $p(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the prior distribution of the regression coefficients.

## Estimation and Inference

In general, the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients in Bayesian Poisson regression does not have a closed-form expression. Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to approximate the posterior distribution. One common approach is to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or the Gibbs sampler. These methods generate samples from the posterior distribution, which can be used to estimate the mean, variance, and other quantities of interest.

Once we have obtained samples from the posterior distribution, we can use them for prediction and uncertainty quantification. For example, to predict the expected count for a new observation $\boldsymbol{X}_\text{new}$, we can compute the posterior predictive distribution:


$$

p(Y_\text{new} | \boldsymbol{X}_\text{new}, \boldsymbol{Y}, \boldsymbol{X}) = \int p(Y_\text{new} | \boldsymbol{X}_\text{new}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) p(\boldsymbol{\beta} | \boldsymbol{Y}, \boldsymbol{X}) d\boldsymbol{\beta}

$$


This integral can be approximated using the samples from the posterior distribution:


$$

p(Y_\text{new} | \boldsymbol{X}_\text{new}, \boldsymbol{Y}, \boldsymbol{X}) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N p(Y_\text{new} | \boldsymbol{X}_\text{new}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^{(n)})

$$


where $\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(n)}$ is the $n$-th sample from the posterior distribution, and $N$ is the total number of samples.

## Applications

Bayesian Poisson regression has been widely used in various fields, such as epidemiology, ecology, and finance, for modeling count data with complex dependencies and incorporating prior knowledge about the model parameters. Some examples of applications include disease incidence modeling, species abundance estimation, and modeling the number of financial defaults.

In summary, Bayesian Poisson regression is a powerful statistical modeling technique that combines the principles of Bayesian inference with Poisson regression for count data. This approach allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the model parameters and provides a full posterior distribution over the parameters, which can be used for model comparison, prediction, and uncertainty quantification.
