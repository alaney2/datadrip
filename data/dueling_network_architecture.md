# Dueling Network Architecture

Dueling Network Architecture is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2016 by Ziyu Wang et al. at Google DeepMind. The architecture separates the values and advantages of the Q function, which is used in reinforcement learning, to improve the learning process and better estimate the Q values of different actions in a given state.

## Architecture

The Dueling Network Architecture is composed of two streams: the value stream and the advantage stream. The value stream estimates the value of being in a certain state, while the advantage stream estimates the advantage of taking a certain action in that state. The two streams are then combined to obtain the Q function:

$$Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - \frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a'}A(s,a')$$

where $V(s)$ is the value of the state, $A(s,a)$ is the advantage of taking action $a$ in state $s$, and $\frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a'}A(s,a')$ is the mean advantage of all possible actions in state $s$. 

## Advantages

The Dueling Network Architecture has several advantages over traditional Q-networks. Separating the value and advantage streams allows the network to better estimate the Q values of different actions in a given state, especially when some actions have similar advantages. Additionally, the architecture reduces the variance of the Q values, which can lead to more stable and efficient learning. 

## Applications

The Dueling Network Architecture has been applied in various domains, including game playing, robotics, and natural language processing. One notable application is in the Atari game Breakout, where the architecture achieved state-of-the-art results.
