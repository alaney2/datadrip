# Balanced Accuracy

Balanced accuracy is a classification metric used to evaluate the performance of a classifier, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. It is a more informative metric than the traditional accuracy score, as it takes into account both the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the true negative rate (specificity). Balanced accuracy is defined as the average of sensitivity and specificity, and it ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score.

## Imbalanced Datasets

In many real-world classification problems, the distribution of classes in the dataset is not balanced. This means that one class may have significantly more samples than the other classes. In such cases, using the traditional accuracy score as a performance metric can be misleading, as a classifier that predicts the majority class for all samples would still achieve a high accuracy score.

For example, consider a binary classification problem with 100 samples, where 90 samples belong to class A and 10 samples belong to class B. A classifier that predicts class A for all samples would achieve an accuracy of 90%, even though it completely fails to identify any samples from class B. In such cases, balanced accuracy provides a more informative evaluation of the classifier's performance.

## Definition

Balanced accuracy is defined as the average of sensitivity (also known as recall) and specificity. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives among the positive samples, while specificity is the proportion of true negatives among the negative samples. Mathematically, balanced accuracy can be expressed as:


$$

\text{Balanced Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Sensitivity} + \text{Specificity}}{2}

$$


where


$$

\text{Sensitivity} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}

$$


and


$$

\text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{True Negatives}}{\text{True Negatives} + \text{False Positives}}

$$


## Advantages and Limitations

Balanced accuracy has several advantages over the traditional accuracy score:

1. It provides a more informative evaluation of classifier performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
2. It takes into account both the true positive rate and the true negative rate, making it less sensitive to the distribution of classes in the dataset.
3. It is easy to compute and interpret, as it ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score.

However, balanced accuracy also has some limitations:

1. It may not be suitable for multi-class classification problems, as it is primarily designed for binary classification. In multi-class problems, other metrics such as macro-averaged F1 score or macro-averaged precision and recall may be more appropriate.
2. It does not take into account the cost of misclassification, which may be different for different classes. In such cases, a cost-sensitive metric like the weighted F1 score or the weighted precision and recall may be more suitable.

## Conclusion

Balanced accuracy is a useful classification metric for evaluating the performance of classifiers, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. It provides a more informative evaluation than the traditional accuracy score, as it takes into account both the true positive rate and the true negative rate. However, it may not be suitable for all classification problems, and other metrics such as macro-averaged F1 score or weighted precision and recall may be more appropriate in some cases.
