# Fully Convolutional Networks

**Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)** are a type of neural network that are used for image segmentation tasks. They were first introduced by Long et al. in their 2015 paper, "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation."

## Architecture

The architecture of a FCN consists of only convolutional layers and pooling layers. This is in contrast to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which typically include fully connected layers at the end. FCNs also make use of transposed convolutions, which allow for the upsampling of feature maps.

One common architecture for a FCN is the **U-Net**, which was introduced by Ronneberger et al. in their 2015 paper, "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation." The U-Net consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which allows for the combination of high-level and low-level features.

## Training

FCNs are typically trained using backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent. The loss function used for image segmentation tasks is often the **cross-entropy loss**, which measures the difference between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation.

Data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flips and rotations, can also be used to increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting.

## Applications

FCNs have been used for a variety of image segmentation tasks, including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. They have also been used in medical image analysis, such as for the segmentation of tumors in MRI scans.

## Conclusion

Fully Convolutional Networks are a powerful tool for image segmentation tasks, allowing for the efficient processing of large images. Their use of only convolutional and pooling layers allows for the generation of dense predictions for each pixel in an image. FCNs have already been successfully applied to a variety of applications, and their use is likely to continue to grow in the future.
