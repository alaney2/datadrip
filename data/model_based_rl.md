# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

Model-Based Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that involves learning a model of the environment in order to make decisions that maximize a reward signal. In contrast to Model-Free RL, which learns directly from experience, Model-Based RL involves building a model of the environment and using it to plan actions.

## Overview

In Model-Based RL, the agent learns a model of the environment, which can be used to simulate future states and rewards. The agent then uses this model to plan actions that will maximize the expected reward. The model can be learned using a variety of techniques, including Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo methods.

One of the main advantages of Model-Based RL is that it can be more sample-efficient than Model-Free RL. By using the learned model to plan actions, the agent can avoid costly trial-and-error learning. However, Model-Based RL can also be more computationally expensive, as it requires learning and maintaining a model of the environment.

## Markov Decision Processes

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a common framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems in RL. An MDP consists of a set of states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. At each time step, the agent observes the current state and takes an action, which transitions the environment to a new state and generates a reward. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a family of algorithms for solving MDPs. DP algorithms involve iteratively computing the optimal value function or policy for the MDP. The optimal value function represents the expected cumulative reward starting from each state, while the optimal policy specifies the best action to take in each state.

## Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that use random sampling to estimate the value function or policy for an MDP. Monte Carlo methods involve simulating episodes of the MDP and using the observed returns to update the value function or policy.
