# Multivariable Calculus

Multivariable calculus, also known as vector calculus, is the branch of calculus that deals with functions of several variables. It extends the concepts and techniques of calculus from one-dimensional and two-dimensional functions to higher dimensions.

## Prerequisites

To understand multivariable calculus, one should have a strong understanding of the following topics:

- **Limits:** The concept of limits is essential to understanding the behavior of a function as it approaches a particular point or value.
- **Derivatives:** Derivatives are used to find the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a particular point.
- **Partial Derivatives:** Partial derivatives are used to find the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables while holding all other variables constant.
- **Vectors:** Vectors are used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are essential in multivariable calculus as they are used to describe the geometry of the space in which the functions are defined.
- **Matrices:** Matrices are used to represent linear transformations between vectors. They are also used to compute the derivatives of functions of several variables.

## Concepts

### Functions of several variables

A function of several variables is a function that takes multiple inputs and returns a single output. For example, a function that takes the coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space and returns the temperature at that point is a function of three variables.

### Partial derivatives

The partial derivative of a function of several variables with respect to one of its variables is the derivative of the function with respect to that variable, holding all other variables constant. It is denoted by the partial derivative symbol ∂. For example, the partial derivative of a function f(x,y) with respect to x is denoted by ∂f/∂x and is computed by treating y as a constant and taking the derivative of f(x,y) with respect to x.

### Gradient

The gradient of a function of several variables is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest increase of the function at a particular point. It is computed by taking the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable and forming a vector with these partial derivatives as its components.

### Chain rule

The chain rule is a rule for computing the derivative of a composite function. It states that the derivative of a composite function is equal to the product of the derivatives of its component functions. In multivariable calculus, the chain rule is used to compute the derivative of a function of several variables with respect to another function of several variables.

### Taylor series

The Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are derived from the function's derivatives at a single point. In multivariable calculus, the Taylor series is used to approximate the value of a function at a particular point by using its derivatives at that point.

### Surface integrals

A surface integral is an integral over a surface in three-dimensional space. It is used to compute the flux of a vector field across a surface. In multivariable calculus, surface integrals are used to compute the work done by a force field on an object that moves along a path in space.
