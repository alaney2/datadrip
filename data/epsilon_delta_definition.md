# Epsilon Delta Definition

The epsilon delta definition is a tool used in calculus to precisely define limits and continuity. It is a way to prove that a function has a limit or is continuous at a certain point. 

## Limits

The epsilon delta definition is used to formally define limits. A limit is a value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value. The formal definition of a limit is:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$

This means that as x gets closer and closer to a, f(x) gets arbitrarily close to L. The epsilon delta definition provides a way to prove that this statement is true for a given function.

## Epsilon Delta Definition

The epsilon delta definition is as follows: 

For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x-a| < \delta$, then $|f(x)-L| < \epsilon$.

This definition may seem confusing at first, but it is actually quite simple. It states that for any positive value of $\epsilon$, there exists a positive value of $\delta$ such that if the distance between x and a is less than $\delta$, then the distance between f(x) and L is less than $\epsilon$. This means that we can make f(x) arbitrarily close to L by choosing a small enough value of $\delta$.

## Continuity

The epsilon delta definition can also be used to formally define continuity. A function is continuous at a point if it satisfies the following definition:

A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ if and only if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $|x-a| < \delta$, then $|f(x)-f(a)| < \epsilon$.

This means that as x gets arbitrarily close to a, f(x) gets arbitrarily close to f(a). This is the same as saying that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is equal to f(a).

## Conclusion

The epsilon delta definition is a powerful tool used in calculus to formally define limits and continuity. It provides a way to prove that a function has a limit or is continuous at a certain point. By understanding this definition, students can gain a deeper understanding of calculus and its applications.
