# Deep Reinforcement Learning Frameworks

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that deals with training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. DRL has been successfully applied to various domains such as robotics, gaming, and finance. DRL frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries to implement and train DRL models efficiently.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of ML that deals with training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. RL agents learn from their experiences by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. The goal of RL is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of ML that deals with training neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data. DL has been successfully applied to various domains such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. DL is a key component of DRL frameworks as it provides the ability to learn complex policies from high-dimensional input spaces.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks (NN) are a type of DL model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. NNs consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that process input data and learn to make predictions. NNs are a key component of DRL frameworks as they provide the ability to learn complex policies from high-dimensional input spaces.

## Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic Methods are a type of RL algorithm that combines the advantages of both policy-based and value-based methods. Actor-Critic Methods maintain two models: an actor model that learns the policy and a critic model that learns the value function. Actor-Critic Methods have been successfully applied to various domains such as robotics and gaming.

## Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient Methods are a type of RL algorithm that directly optimize the policy by computing gradients of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. Policy Gradient Methods have been successfully applied to various domains such as robotics and gaming.

## Value Iteration

Value Iteration is a type of RL algorithm that iteratively computes the optimal value function by estimating the expected cumulative reward for each state. Value Iteration is a key component of value-based RL algorithms such as Q-Learning and SARSA.

DRL frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries to implement and train DRL models efficiently. Some popular DRL frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide a set of high-level APIs to define and train DRL models, as well as a set of pre-built DRL models for various domains. DRL frameworks also provide a set of tools to visualize and analyze the performance of DRL models.
