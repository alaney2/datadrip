# Graph Neural Networks

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network that operate on graph-structured data. They are used for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, and have applications in fields such as social network analysis, drug discovery, and recommendation systems.

## Overview

GNNs are composed of layers that operate on graphs. Each layer aggregates information from the node's neighbors and updates the node's features, which are then passed to the next layer. This process is repeated for each layer, allowing the network to capture increasingly complex relationships between nodes.

There are two main types of GNNs: spectral-based and spatial-based. Spectral-based GNNs operate in the Fourier domain and use the graph Laplacian matrix to perform convolutions, while spatial-based GNNs operate in the spatial domain and use message-passing to update node features.

## Applications

GNNs have a wide range of applications, including:

- **Social network analysis:** GNNs can be used to predict missing links in social networks, identify influential nodes, and detect communities.

- **Drug discovery:** GNNs can be used to predict the properties of molecules and identify potential drug candidates.

- **Recommendation systems:** GNNs can be used to model user-item interactions in recommendation systems.

- **Computer vision:** GNNs can be used for tasks such as object detection and segmentation in images and videos.

## Limitations

GNNs have several limitations, including:

- **Limited scalability:** GNNs can be computationally expensive and may not scale well to large graphs.

- **Over-smoothing:** GNNs can suffer from over-smoothing, where node features become too similar after several layers, leading to a loss of information.

- **Generalization:** GNNs may not generalize well to unseen graphs or tasks.
