# Early Stopping

**Early stopping** is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor performance on test data, as the model has essentially memorized the training data rather than learning useful features.

Early stopping works by monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training. The validation set is a subset of the data that is held out from the training process and is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. As the model trains, its performance on the validation set is monitored. If the performance on the validation set begins to degrade, training is stopped early, and the model with the best performance on the validation set is selected.

Early stopping is a form of regularization, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that the model is trying to minimize. This penalty term encourages the model to learn simpler patterns in the data, which are less likely to be due to noise.

Early stopping is a simple and effective technique for preventing overfitting in machine learning models. It is widely used in practice and can be implemented easily using most machine learning libraries.

$$\text{Validation Loss}(E) = \frac{1}{|V|}\sum_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \in V} \mathcal{L}(f(\mathbf{x}; E), y)$$

where $V$ is the validation set, $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function, $f(\mathbf{x}; E)$ is the model function with parameters $E$, and $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ is a validation example.

$$\frac{\partial \text{Validation Loss}(E)}{\partial E} = \frac{1}{|V|}\sum_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \in V} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(f(\mathbf{x}; E), y)}{\partial E}$$
