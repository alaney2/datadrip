# Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search

Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search (Deep MCTS) is a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that incorporates neural networks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the search algorithm. MCTS is a popular algorithm used in artificial intelligence for decision-making problems, particularly in games. It is a heuristic search algorithm that builds a search tree by simulating the game from the current state and selecting the best move based on the results of the simulations.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search

MCTS is a four-step process that involves selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. The algorithm starts with a root node that represents the current state of the game. The selection step involves traversing the tree from the root node to a leaf node based on a selection policy, such as the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. The expansion step involves adding one or more child nodes to the selected leaf node, representing the possible moves from the current state. The simulation step involves playing out the game from the newly added child node to the end of the game using a rollout policy, such as a random policy. The backpropagation step involves updating the statistics of the nodes in the path from the selected leaf node to the root node based on the outcome of the simulation.

MCTS is known for its ability to handle large state spaces and imperfect information games, such as Go and Poker. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially for games with long horizons and complex dynamics. Deep MCTS aims to address this issue by incorporating neural networks to guide the search process.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn complex patterns in data. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that perform mathematical operations on the input data to produce an output. Deep neural networks are neural networks with multiple layers, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.

In Deep MCTS, neural networks are used to estimate the value and policy of the game states. The value network estimates the expected outcome of the game from a given state, while the policy network estimates the probability distribution over the possible moves from the state. These estimates are used to guide the selection and expansion steps of the MCTS algorithm, improving its efficiency and effectiveness.

## Applications

Deep MCTS has been successfully applied to various games, including Go, Chess, and Shogi. In 2016, AlphaGo, a computer program that uses Deep MCTS, defeated the world champion in Go, a game considered to be one of the most complex board games in the world. Deep MCTS has also been used in robotics and autonomous driving, where decision-making under uncertainty is a critical challenge.

## Conclusion

Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search is a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search that incorporates neural networks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the search algorithm. It has been successfully applied to various games and decision-making problems, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.
