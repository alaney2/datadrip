# Rectified Adam

Rectified Adam (RAdam) is an optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is widely used in training machine learning and deep learning models. It is an improvement over the commonly used Adam optimizer, which can have erratic behavior in some cases. RAdam combines the benefits of Adam and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function to achieve better performance.

## Background

To understand RAdam, it is important to be familiar with Adam, ReLU, and backpropagation.

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm for SGD. It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter and updates them individually. The adaptive learning rates make it possible to train models quickly and efficiently. However, Adam can have erratic behavior in some cases, such as when the learning rate is too high or too low. This can lead to poor performance and convergence issues.

ReLU is an activation function that is commonly used in deep learning. It is a simple function that outputs the input if it is positive, and zero otherwise. ReLU is known for its effectiveness in training deep neural networks.

Backpropagation is the process of calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter in the model. It is used to update the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, which minimizes the loss.

## How RAdam Works

RAdam combines the adaptive learning rates of Adam and the rectification of ReLU to improve performance. The main difference between RAdam and Adam is in the way the adaptive learning rates are computed.

In Adam, the adaptive learning rates are computed using the first and second moments of the gradients. In RAdam, the adaptive learning rates are computed using the first, second, and third moments of the gradients. The third moment is used to correct the bias introduced by the first two moments in the early stages of training.

RAdam also includes a rectification term, which is similar to the rectification in ReLU. This term ensures that the updates to the parameters are always in the correct direction. The rectification term is computed using the variance of the gradients.

## Advantages of RAdam

RAdam has several advantages over other optimization algorithms:

- RAdam is more robust than Adam in terms of hyperparameter tuning. It is less sensitive to the choice of learning rate and batch size.
- RAdam achieves better performance than Adam on a wide range of deep learning tasks.
- RAdam is computationally efficient and scales well to large datasets and models.

## Conclusion

Rectified Adam (RAdam) is an optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that combines the benefits of Adam and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. It is an improvement over Adam and achieves better performance on a wide range of deep learning tasks. RAdam is computationally efficient and scales well to large datasets and models.
