# Hough Transform

The Hough Transform is a feature extraction technique used in image processing and computer vision to detect simple shapes such as lines, circles, and ellipses. It was first introduced by Paul Hough in 1962 and later improved by Richard Duda and Peter Hart in 1972. The Hough Transform is particularly useful for detecting shapes that can be represented mathematically, even in noisy images or when the shape is partially occluded.

## Overview

The main idea behind the Hough Transform is to transform the image from the spatial domain (i.e., the Cartesian coordinate system) to a parameter space, where each point in the parameter space represents a set of possible shapes in the spatial domain. By accumulating votes for each point in the parameter space, the Hough Transform can identify the most likely shapes present in the image.

The Hough Transform is typically applied to binary images, where edge detection algorithms (such as the Canny edge detector) have already been used to identify the boundaries of the shapes. The edge pixels in the binary image are then used as input to the Hough Transform algorithm.

## Line Detection

The most common application of the Hough Transform is line detection. In this case, the parameter space is the polar coordinate system, where each point is represented by a distance $ρ$ and an angle $θ$. A line in the Cartesian coordinate system can be represented as:


$$

y = mx + b

$$


where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. However, this representation is not suitable for the Hough Transform, as vertical lines would have an infinite slope. Instead, the line can be represented in polar coordinates as:


$$

ρ = x \cos θ + y \sin θ

$$


where $ρ$ is the distance from the origin to the line, and $θ$ is the angle between the $x$-axis and the line perpendicular to the detected line.

For each edge pixel $(x, y)$ in the binary image, the Hough Transform computes the corresponding values of $ρ$ and $θ$ for a range of possible angles. The parameter space is discretized into accumulator cells, and each computed $(ρ, θ)$ pair contributes a vote to the corresponding cell. The cells with the highest number of votes represent the most likely lines in the image.

To identify the lines, a threshold is applied to the accumulator cells, and the remaining cells are considered as detected lines. The lines can then be drawn back onto the original image for visualization or further processing.

## Circle Detection

The Hough Transform can also be used to detect circles in an image. In this case, the parameter space is three-dimensional, with each point represented by the circle's center coordinates $(a, b)$ and its radius $r$. A circle in the Cartesian coordinate system can be represented as:


$$

(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2

$$


For each edge pixel $(x, y)$ in the binary image, the Hough Transform computes the corresponding values of $(a, b, r)$ for a range of possible radii. The parameter space is discretized into accumulator cells, and each computed $(a, b, r)$ triplet contributes a vote to the corresponding cell. The cells with the highest number of votes represent the most likely circles in the image.

As with line detection, a threshold is applied to the accumulator cells to identify the detected circles, which can then be drawn back onto the original image.

## Variants and Extensions

Several variants and extensions of the Hough Transform have been proposed to detect other shapes or improve the performance of the original algorithm. Some of these include:

- **Circle Hough Transform**: A specialized version of the Hough Transform for detecting circles, which reduces the computational complexity by using a gradient-based approach.
- **Ellipse Hough Transform**: An extension of the Hough Transform for detecting ellipses, which requires a four-dimensional parameter space.
- **Generalized Hough Transform**: A more general version of the Hough Transform that can detect arbitrary shapes, given a template or model of the shape.
- **Radon Transform**: A related technique used in tomography and image reconstruction, which is mathematically equivalent to the Hough Transform for line detection.

## Applications

The Hough Transform has been widely used in various applications, including:

- Image segmentation: Separating different regions of an image based on their shapes.
- Object recognition: Identifying objects in an image based on their geometric properties.
- Lane detection: Identifying road lanes in autonomous vehicle systems.
- Document analysis: Detecting lines and other geometric structures in scanned documents.

## Limitations

Despite its usefulness, the Hough Transform has some limitations:

- It is computationally expensive, especially for detecting complex shapes or when the parameter space has a high dimensionality.
- It is sensitive to noise and may produce false detections in the presence of spurious edge pixels.
- It may have difficulty detecting shapes that are partially occluded or have gaps in their boundaries.
- It requires prior knowledge of the shapes to be detected, which may not always be available or accurate.
