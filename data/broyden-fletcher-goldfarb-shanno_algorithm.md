# Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Algorithm

The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm is a popular iterative method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. It belongs to the class of Quasi-Newton methods, which are a generalization of the Newton's method for optimization. BFGS was independently developed by four researchers - Charles G. Broyden, Roger Fletcher, Donald Goldfarb, and David Shanno - and hence named after them.

## Overview

The BFGS algorithm is based on the Newton's method for finding the stationary point of a function, where the gradient of the function is zero. However, unlike the Newton's method, which requires the computation of the Hessian matrix (second derivatives of the function) and its inversion, the BFGS algorithm approximates the Hessian using updates specified by gradient evaluations (or approximate gradient evaluations).

The BFGS algorithm starts with an initial guess for the solution and an initial guess for the Hessian matrix. At each iteration, it computes the gradient of the function at the current point, and then updates the current point and the Hessian approximation based on these values.

## Algorithm

The BFGS algorithm can be described as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Choose an initial point $x_0$ and an initial Hessian approximation $B_0$. Set $k = 0$.

2. **Gradient computation**: Compute the gradient $g_k = \nabla f(x_k)$.

3. **Direction computation**: Solve the linear system $B_k p_k = -g_k$ to get the direction $p_k$.

4. **Line search**: Choose a step size $\alpha_k$ that satisfies certain conditions (e.g., the Wolfe conditions), and set $x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k$.

5. **Hessian update**: Compute $g_{k+1} = \nabla f(x_{k+1})$ and update the Hessian approximation $B_{k+1}$ using the BFGS update formula.

6. **Iteration**: Set $k = k + 1$ and go back to step 2.

The BFGS update formula for the Hessian approximation is designed to ensure that the updated Hessian approximation maintains certain desirable properties, such as positive definiteness.

## Applications

The BFGS algorithm is widely used in machine learning and data mining for training models, such as neural networks and support vector machines, where the objective function is a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predictions of the model and the actual data. It is also used in other fields that involve optimization, such as operations research, economics, and physics.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The main advantage of the BFGS algorithm is that it often converges faster than other methods, such as the gradient descent method, especially for problems with a large number of variables. It also does not require the computation and storage of the full Hessian matrix, which makes it more efficient for large-scale problems.

However, the BFGS algorithm also has some disadvantages. It may not converge for non-convex functions or functions with discontinuities. It also requires the choice of a suitable line search method and the tuning of its parameters, which can be challenging in practice.
