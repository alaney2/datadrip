# Retrieval Metrics

Retrieval metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval systems, such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering systems. These metrics help to measure the quality of the retrieved results by comparing them with a set of relevant documents or items. The main goal of retrieval metrics is to quantify the performance of a system in terms of its ability to retrieve relevant items while minimizing the number of irrelevant items.

There are several retrieval metrics that are commonly used in the field of information retrieval, machine learning, and deep learning. Some of the most popular metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, mean average precision (MAP), discounted cumulative gain (DCG), and area under the ROC curve (AUC). In this article, we will discuss these metrics in detail and provide an overview of their applications and limitations.

## Precision and Recall

Precision and recall are two fundamental metrics used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval systems. Precision measures the proportion of relevant items among the retrieved items, while recall measures the proportion of relevant items that have been retrieved out of the total number of relevant items.

Mathematically, precision and recall can be defined as follows:


$$

\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{Number of relevant items retrieved}}{\text{Total number of items retrieved}}

$$



$$

\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of relevant items retrieved}}{\text{Total number of relevant items}}

$$


Precision and recall are often used together to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a system's performance. One common way to combine these metrics is by calculating the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:


$$

\text{F1-score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}

$$


The F1-score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect precision and recall.

## Mean Average Precision (MAP)

Mean average precision (MAP) is a popular metric used to evaluate the performance of ranking algorithms in information retrieval systems. MAP calculates the average precision at different recall levels and provides a single value that summarizes the system's performance across all recall levels.

To compute MAP, first, the average precision (AP) is calculated for each query. AP is the average of the precision values obtained after each relevant item is retrieved. Then, the mean of the AP values for all queries is calculated to obtain the MAP value.


$$

\text{MAP} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q} \text{AP}_q

$$


where $Q$ is the number of queries and $\text{AP}_q$ is the average precision for query $q$.

MAP is particularly useful for evaluating systems that return a ranked list of items, as it takes into account both the order of the retrieved items and the number of relevant items retrieved.

## Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)

Discounted cumulative gain (DCG) is another metric used to evaluate the performance of ranking algorithms in information retrieval systems. DCG measures the usefulness of the retrieved items, taking into account their relevance and position in the ranked list.

The DCG for a ranked list of items is calculated as follows:


$$

\text{DCG} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\text{Relevance}_i}{\log_2(i+1)}

$$


where $N$ is the number of items in the ranked list, and $\text{Relevance}_i$ is the relevance score of the item at position $i$.

To compare the performance of different ranking algorithms, the DCG values are often normalized by dividing them by the ideal DCG (IDCG), which is the DCG value obtained when the items are ranked in the perfect order according to their relevance scores. The normalized DCG (nDCG) is then calculated as:


$$

\text{nDCG} = \frac{\text{DCG}}{\text{IDCG}}

$$


nDCG ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect ranking.

## Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, or AUC, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classification algorithms. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The AUC measures the area under the ROC curve and provides a single value that summarizes the classifier's performance across all classification thresholds.

AUC ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect classification and 0.5 indicating random classification. A higher AUC value indicates better classifier performance.

## Applications and Limitations

Retrieval metrics are widely used in various domains, such as search engines, recommendation systems, question-answering systems, and document classification. They provide valuable insights into the performance of information retrieval systems and help researchers and practitioners to compare different algorithms and models.

However, it is essential to keep in mind that these metrics have limitations and may not always provide a complete picture of a system's performance. For example, precision and recall do not take into account the order of the retrieved items, while DCG and nDCG do not consider the number of relevant items retrieved. Moreover, some metrics, such as AUC, are only applicable to specific types of problems, such as binary classification.

Therefore, it is crucial to choose the appropriate retrieval metrics based on the specific problem and the characteristics of the information retrieval system being evaluated. In some cases, it may be necessary to use multiple metrics to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance.
