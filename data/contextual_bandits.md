# Contextual Bandits

Contextual bandits are a type of machine learning algorithm that are used in decision-making problems where the agent (or learner) must choose an action based on contextual information. These algorithms are a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning, and are used in situations where the agent must make decisions without knowing the true reward of each action.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments for each action it takes, and its goal is to maximize the total reward it receives over time. Contextual bandits are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Multi-Armed Bandits

Multi-armed bandits are a type of decision-making problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions, each with an unknown reward. The goal is to maximize the total reward received over time. Contextual bandits are a type of multi-armed bandit algorithm.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the agent learns from labeled data. The agent is given input-output pairs, and its goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs. Contextual bandits are a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning, as they use labeled data to learn the optimal action to take in a given context.

## Online Learning

Online learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the agent learns from data that arrives in a stream. The agent must make decisions in real-time, and its goal is to learn from the data as it arrives. Contextual bandits are a type of online learning algorithm.

## Decision Trees

Decision trees are a type of machine learning algorithm that are used for decision-making problems. They are a type of supervised learning algorithm that learn a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Contextual bandits can be thought of as a type of decision tree, where the agent must choose the optimal action based on the context.

## Exploration vs Exploitation

Exploration vs exploitation is a trade-off that arises in decision-making problems where the agent must choose between exploring new options and exploiting known options. In contextual bandits, the agent must balance the exploration of new actions with the exploitation of known actions in order to maximize the total reward received over time.

In conclusion, contextual bandits are a type of machine learning algorithm that are used in decision-making problems where the agent must choose an action based on contextual information. They are a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning, and are used in situations where the agent must make decisions without knowing the true reward of each action. Contextual bandits are a type of online learning algorithm that balance the exploration of new actions with the exploitation of known actions in order to maximize the total reward received over time.
