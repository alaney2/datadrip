# Expectation Propagation

Expectation Propagation (EP) is an approximate inference algorithm used in the context of Bayesian inference and probabilistic graphical models. It is particularly useful for dealing with complex models where exact inference is intractable. EP is a member of the family of message-passing algorithms, which also includes Belief Propagation (BP) and Variational Inference (VI). EP is designed to approximate the true posterior distribution of a model by iteratively refining a simpler, tractable distribution.

## Background

Bayesian inference involves updating our beliefs about unknown variables given observed data. In probabilistic graphical models, this is often done by computing the posterior distribution of the unknown variables given the observed data. However, exact inference is often intractable due to the complexity of the model or the size of the state space. In such cases, approximate inference techniques like EP can be used to obtain an approximation of the true posterior distribution.

EP is based on the idea of iteratively refining an approximation to the true posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true distribution and the approximation. The KL divergence is a measure of the dissimilarity between two probability distributions, and minimizing it ensures that the approximation is as close as possible to the true distribution.

## Algorithm

The EP algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the approximate distribution $q(\mathbf{x})$ to a tractable distribution, such as a Gaussian or a factorized distribution.
2. For each factor $f_i(\mathbf{x})$ in the true distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$:
    a. Remove the contribution of $f_i(\mathbf{x})$ from the current approximation $q(\mathbf{x})$.
    b. Compute the unnormalized distribution $p_i(\mathbf{x}) = f_i(\mathbf{x})q(\mathbf{x})$.
    c. Find a new approximation $q_i(\mathbf{x})$ that minimizes the KL divergence between $p_i(\mathbf{x})$ and $q_i(\mathbf{x})$.
    d. Update the overall approximation $q(\mathbf{x})$ by incorporating the new approximation $q_i(\mathbf{x})$.
3. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence.

The key idea behind EP is to iteratively refine the approximation by considering one factor at a time and updating the approximation to minimize the KL divergence between the true distribution and the approximation. This is done by first removing the contribution of the current factor from the approximation, computing the unnormalized distribution, and then finding a new approximation that minimizes the KL divergence. The overall approximation is then updated by incorporating the new approximation.

## Advantages and Limitations

EP has several advantages over other approximate inference techniques:

- It can provide accurate approximations even for complex models with many interacting variables.
- It is relatively efficient, as it only requires local computations for each factor in the model.
- It can be easily parallelized, as the updates for each factor can be performed independently.

However, EP also has some limitations:

- It is not guaranteed to converge, especially for models with loops or high-dimensional variables.
- The choice of the initial approximation can have a significant impact on the quality of the final approximation.
- It can be sensitive to the order in which the factors are processed, which can affect the convergence and the quality of the approximation.

Despite these limitations, EP has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in machine learning, including classification, regression, and clustering. It has also been extended to handle more complex models, such as those with continuous variables or hierarchical structures.

## Conclusion

Expectation Propagation is an approximate inference algorithm that can be used to obtain an approximation of the true posterior distribution in complex Bayesian models. It is based on the idea of iteratively refining the approximation by minimizing the KL divergence between the true distribution and the approximation. EP has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in machine learning and has been extended to handle more complex models. However, it also has some limitations, such as the potential for non-convergence and sensitivity to the choice of the initial approximation and the order of factor processing.
