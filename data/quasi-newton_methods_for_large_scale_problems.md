# Quasi-Newton Methods for Large Scale Problems

Quasi-Newton methods are a class of optimization algorithms used to solve large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. These methods are generally used when the Hessian matrix (second-order partial derivatives of the objective function) is difficult to compute or is too expensive to compute. Instead of computing the Hessian matrix, Quasi-Newton methods approximate it using other techniques.

Quasi-Newton methods belong to the family of iterative optimization algorithms and are an extension of the Newton's method. Newton's method uses the second-order derivative of the objective function to find the minimum. However, computing the full Hessian matrix can be computationally expensive and may not be feasible for large-scale problems. Quasi-Newton methods approximate the inverse of the Hessian matrix and use it to update the current solution. 

One of the most popular Quasi-Newton optimization algorithms is the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. The L-BFGS algorithm is an iterative optimization algorithm that approximates the inverse of the Hessian matrix using a limited amount of memory. The L-BFGS algorithm is widely used in machine learning and deep learning for solving optimization problems.

Another popular Quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. The CG method is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that searches for the minimum along conjugate directions. The CG method is particularly useful when the Hessian matrix is not positive definite.

Quasi-Newton methods have several advantages over other optimization algorithms. They are efficient for large-scale optimization problems and do not require computing the Hessian matrix directly. Quasi-Newton methods also converge faster than gradient descent methods for smooth objective functions. 

However, Quasi-Newton methods also have some disadvantages. They can be sensitive to the initial conditions and can become unstable if the curvature of the objective function changes quickly. Quasi-Newton methods also require more memory than gradient descent methods.

In conclusion, Quasi-Newton methods are a powerful class of optimization algorithms for large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. They are an extension of the Newton's method and approximate the inverse of the Hessian matrix to find the minimum. The L-BFGS and Conjugate Gradient methods are popular Quasi-Newton optimization algorithms used in machine learning and deep learning.
