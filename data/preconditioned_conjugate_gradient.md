# Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient

The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations, namely those whose matrix is symmetric and positive-definite. The PCG method is often used to solve large linear systems that arise in numerical simulations or optimization problems.

## Overview

The Conjugate Gradient method is a popular iterative method for solving large sparse systems of linear equations. However, the convergence rate of the Conjugate Gradient method can be slow if the matrix of the system has a large condition number. To overcome this issue, the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method is used. 

The idea behind preconditioning is to transform the original system into an equivalent one that has a more favorable condition number. This is achieved by multiplying the original system by a matrix, called the preconditioner, which approximates the inverse of the matrix of the system.

## Algorithm

The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method is an adaptation of the Conjugate Gradient method. The main difference is that in the PCG method, the search directions are generated by a preconditioned version of the original system. 

The algorithm for the PCG method is as follows:

1. Choose an initial guess $x_0$ and compute $r_0 = b - Ax_0$, where $A$ is the matrix of the system and $b$ is the right-hand side vector. Choose a preconditioner $M$.

2. For $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ until convergence:

    a. Solve $Mz_k = r_k$ for $z_k$.
    
    b. Compute $\beta_k = r_k^Tz_k / r_{k-1}^Tz_{k-1}$ for $k > 0$ (set $\beta_0 = 0$).
    
    c. Update the search direction $p_k = z_k + \beta_k p_{k-1}$ (set $p_0 = z_0$).
    
    d. Compute $\alpha_k = r_k^Tz_k / p_k^TA p_k$.
    
    e. Update the solution $x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k$.
    
    f. Update the residual $r_{k+1} = r_k - \alpha_k Ap_k$.

3. The solution to the system is the last computed $x_k$.

## Preconditioners

The choice of the preconditioner is crucial for the performance of the PCG method. The preconditioner should be easy to compute and its application should be computationally cheap. Moreover, it should approximate the inverse of the matrix of the system well. Common choices for the preconditioner include the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Incomplete LU factorization.

## Applications

The PCG method is widely used in scientific computing and engineering, particularly in the solution of large sparse systems of linear equations that arise in finite element methods or finite difference methods. It is also used in machine learning and data mining for solving optimization problems.

## Limitations

The PCG method requires the matrix of the system to be symmetric and positive-definite. If the matrix is not symmetric or positive-definite, other methods such as the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES) method or the Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method should be used.
