# Stacking Ensemble

Stacking ensemble, also known as stacked generalization, is a machine learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base level models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is fitted on the outputs, or the "meta-features", of the base level models to make a final prediction.

## Overview

Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance compared to any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike bagging and boosting, stacking can be used to harness the capabilities of a heterogeneous set of classifiers. It is based on a simple idea: instead of using trivial functions (like hard voting) to aggregate the predictions of all predictors, why donâ€™t we train a model to perform this aggregation?

## How Stacking Works

The procedure of stacking involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs.

The steps to perform stacking are:

1. Split the dataset into a training set and a holdout set. We can use k-fold cross-validation.
2. Split the training set again into training and validation sets.
3. Train each base model on the training set and predict on the validation set.
4. Use the base models' predictions on the validation set as input, and the correct labels as output to train a higher level learner.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Stacking is a quite successful way to improve the performances of a variety of machine learning models. However, it also has its disadvantages:

### Advantages

- It improves the prediction accuracy.
- It allows for using the strengths of each individual model by stacking them.
- It provides a way to enforce the strengths of a model, the ensemble can balance the strengths and weaknesses of a collection of models.

### Disadvantages

- It significantly increases the computational complexity.
- It may lead to overfitting, especially when the number of layers is large.
- It requires careful design, as the performance can be highly sensitive to the choice of the meta-model.

## Applications

Stacking ensemble has been successfully used in a variety of machine learning applications, such as:

- Predictive modeling, where it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions.
- Image and speech recognition, where it can be used to combine the outputs of several specialized models.
- Bioinformatics, where it can be used to predict protein structures.

## Conclusion

Stacking ensemble is a powerful machine learning technique that can improve the performance of a set of weak learners and has been widely used in a variety of application areas. However, it requires careful implementation and may increase computational complexity.
