# Distributed Reinforcement Learning

Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that focuses on training agents in a distributed environment. In DRL, multiple agents work together to solve a common task by sharing their experiences and learning from each other. This approach can lead to faster learning and better performance compared to single-agent RL.

## How it works

In DRL, each agent has its own local copy of the environment and interacts with it independently. The agents communicate with each other to share their experiences and learn from each other. This communication can happen in different ways, such as parameter sharing, message passing, or centralized training with decentralized execution.

One of the main challenges in DRL is to ensure that the agents learn a coordinated policy that maximizes the global reward, rather than a set of individual policies that may not work well together. To address this challenge, various methods have been proposed, such as centralized training with decentralized execution, multi-agent actor-critic methods, and population-based training.

## Applications

DRL has been applied to various domains, such as robotics, games, and traffic control. In robotics, DRL has been used to train robots to perform complex tasks, such as grasping objects and walking. In games, DRL has been used to train agents to play games, such as Go and Poker, at a superhuman level. In traffic control, DRL has been used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
