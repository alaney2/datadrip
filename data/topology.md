# Topology

Topology is the study of the properties and relationships of spaces that are preserved under continuous transformations such as stretching, bending, and twisting, but not tearing or gluing. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the abstract concepts of space and continuity.

## Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. In topology, sets are used to define the open and closed sets of a space, which form the basis for defining continuity, convergence, and other topological concepts.

## Graph Theory

Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. In topology, graphs are used to represent networks of points and lines, which can be used to study the connectivity and structure of a space.

## Metric Spaces

A metric space is a set of points with a distance function, or metric, that satisfies certain properties. In topology, metric spaces are used to define the notion of distance between points in a space, and to study properties such as completeness, compactness, and continuity.

## Further Readings

- Algebraic Topology: Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic techniques to study topological spaces. It provides tools for computing topological invariants such as homology and cohomology groups, which can be used to distinguish between different types of spaces.
- Differential Topology: Differential topology is a branch of topology that studies smooth manifolds, which are spaces that locally resemble Euclidean space. It provides tools for studying the geometry and topology of these spaces, and for understanding the behavior of differential equations on them.
- Point Set Topology: Point set topology is the branch of topology that studies topological spaces in their most general form, without any additional structure such as a metric or a differential structure. It provides a framework for studying the general properties of spaces, such as compactness, connectedness, and separability.
