# Line Search Methods

Line search methods are a class of optimization algorithms used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The goal of these methods is to find the optimal step size (also known as the learning rate) to update the parameters of a model during the training process. 

## Gradient Descent and Newton's Method

Before diving into line search methods, it's important to understand the two most commonly used optimization algorithms: gradient descent and Newton's method. Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that moves the parameters of a model in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Newton's method, on the other hand, uses the second-order derivative (also known as the Hessian matrix) of the loss function to find the minimum.

## How Line Search Methods Work

Line search methods use a search procedure to find the optimal step size. The basic idea is to evaluate the loss function at multiple points along a line in the direction of the negative gradient (or the direction provided by other optimization algorithms). The step size that results in the smallest loss is chosen as the optimal step size. 

There are two main types of line search methods: **exact line search** and **inexact line search**. Exact line search involves evaluating the loss function at every point along the line to find the exact minimum. Inexact line search, on the other hand, only evaluates the loss function at a few points along the line and uses interpolation methods to approximate the minimum.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The main advantage of line search methods is that they can be more efficient than fixed step size methods (such as gradient descent with a fixed learning rate). This is because line search methods adapt the step size to the local curvature of the loss function, which can result in faster convergence.

However, line search methods can also be computationally expensive, especially if an exact line search is used. In addition, line search methods can be sensitive to noise in the loss function, which can make it difficult to find the optimal step size.
