# Hidden States

Hidden states are variables that capture information about the state of a system that is not directly observable. In machine learning, hidden states are commonly used in models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

In an HMM, the hidden states represent the underlying structure of the observed data. For example, in speech recognition, an HMM might be used to model the hidden states of phonemes, while the observed data would be the audio signal. The hidden states capture information about the phonemes that are being spoken, which can then be used to recognize words.

In an RNN, the hidden states are used to capture information about the previous inputs to the network. Each hidden state is a function of the current input and the previous hidden state. By capturing information about the previous inputs, the RNN is able to model sequential data, such as time series or natural language.

Hidden states are often used in conjunction with backpropagation and gradient descent to train machine learning models. In this context, the hidden states are treated as additional parameters of the model that are updated during training.

There are several techniques that have been developed to improve the use of hidden states in machine learning models. One such technique is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which uses gated units to selectively update and forget hidden state information. Another technique is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is similar to the LSTM but has fewer parameters.

Outside of machine learning, hidden states are also used in signal processing and control theory. For example, the Kalman filter and particle filter are methods for estimating the hidden states of a system based on noisy measurements.

In summary, hidden states are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems in machine learning and beyond. They allow for the capture of information that is not directly observable, which can then be used to make predictions or control the system.
