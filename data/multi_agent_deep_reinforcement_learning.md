# Multi Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

Multi Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Multi Agent Systems (MAS) to enable multiple agents to learn and interact with each other in complex environments. 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

DRL is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL) to enable agents to learn from their environment through trial and error. RL is a type of learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. DL is a type of learning where a neural network is used to approximate a function that maps inputs to outputs. 

## Multi Agent Systems

MAS is a subfield of AI that focuses on the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents. These agents can be autonomous or controlled by humans and can have different goals and objectives. The agents can interact with each other in different ways, such as cooperation, competition, or coordination. 

## MADRL

MADRL combines DRL and MAS to enable multiple agents to learn and interact with each other in complex environments. In MADRL, each agent has its own DRL algorithm and neural network that enables it to learn from its own experiences. The agents can also communicate with each other to share information and coordinate their actions. 

MADRL has many applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and game theory. It has also been used to solve complex problems that cannot be solved by a single agent, such as traffic control and disaster response. 

## Actor Critic Methods

Actor Critic Methods are a type of DRL algorithm that combines the policy-based and value-based methods. The actor learns to select actions based on the current policy, while the critic learns to estimate the value of the current state. This enables the agent to learn both the optimal policy and the optimal value function. 

## Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient Methods are a type of DRL algorithm that directly optimizes the policy of the agent. The policy is represented by a neural network that takes the state as input and outputs the probability distribution over actions. The policy is updated using the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. 

## Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a subfield of RL that focuses on the study of systems composed of multiple interacting agents. MARL enables agents to learn from their own experiences and from the experiences of other agents. It also enables agents to communicate with each other to share information and coordinate their actions. 

MADRL is a subfield of MARL that combines DRL and MAS to enable multiple agents to learn and interact with each other in complex environments. 

In conclusion, MADRL is a subfield of AI that combines DRL and MAS to enable multiple agents to learn and interact with each other in complex environments. It has many applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and game theory. MADRL has also been used to solve complex problems that cannot be solved by a single agent, such as traffic control and disaster response.
