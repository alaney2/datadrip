# Cyclical Learning Rates

Cyclical Learning Rates (CLR) is a technique used in deep learning to adjust the learning rate during training. This technique was introduced by Leslie N. Smith in his paper, ["Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186).

## Overview

CLR is a method of adjusting the learning rate by cyclically varying it between a lower and upper bound. The learning rate is increased from the lower bound to the upper bound over a certain number of iterations, and then decreased back to the lower bound over the same number of iterations. This cycle is repeated multiple times during the training process.

The main goal of CLR is to help the model converge faster by allowing it to escape from local minima. By using a cyclical learning rate instead of a fixed learning rate, the model can explore the space of possible solutions more effectively and find a better global minimum.

## How it Works

CLR is implemented by defining a cyclic learning rate policy. This policy specifies the range of the learning rate, the number of iterations in each cycle, and the shape of the learning rate curve.

One popular policy is the triangular policy, where the learning rate starts at a lower bound, increases linearly to an upper bound, and then decreases linearly back to the lower bound. Another policy is the cosine policy, where the learning rate follows a cosine curve between the lower and upper bounds.

During training, the learning rate is adjusted based on the cyclic policy. The model is trained for a certain number of iterations using the current learning rate, and then the learning rate is updated according to the policy. This process is repeated until the training is complete.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

CLR has several advantages over other learning rate scheduling techniques. It allows the model to converge faster, escape from local minima, and achieve higher accuracy. It is also easy to implement and can be used with any optimizer.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using CLR. It requires more hyperparameters to be tuned, such as the range of the learning rate and the number of iterations in each cycle. It can also be computationally expensive, as it requires training the model for multiple cycles.

## Conclusion

Cyclical Learning Rates is a useful technique for adjusting the learning rate during training in deep learning. It allows the model to explore the space of possible solutions more effectively and find a better global minimum. While it has some disadvantages, it is still a popular technique used in the field of deep learning.
