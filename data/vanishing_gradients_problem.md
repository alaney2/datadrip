# Vanishing Gradients Problem

The vanishing gradients problem is a difficulty encountered in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. This problem becomes significant when dealing with deep neural networks, where the gradient of the loss function decays exponentially with the depth of the network, making the deeper layers very hard to train.

## Understanding the Problem

In a neural network, weights are updated in proportion to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training.

The vanishing gradients problem is particularly troublesome for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In RNNs, the gradient signal can be multiplied a large number of times by the weight matrix associated with the connections between the neurons of the recurrent hidden layer. As a result, the magnitude of weights in the transition matrix can have a strong impact on the learning process.

## Causes of the Problem

The primary cause of the vanishing gradients problem is the choice of the activation function. Sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation functions squash their input into a very narrow range in a very non-linear fashion. For inputs outside the range, the derivative is almost zero. During backpropagation, this local gradient is multiplied with the gradient of this gate's output for the whole objective. Therefore, if the local gradient is very small, it will effectively "kill" the gradient and almost no signal will flow through the neuron to its weights and recursively to its data.

## Solutions to the Problem

Several methods have been proposed to mitigate the vanishing gradients problem:

1. **ReLUs (Rectified Linear Units)**: The ReLU activation function is defined as $f(x) = max(0, x)$. The gradient of this function is always 1 for positive input. This means that during backpropagation, the gradient will not diminish, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

2. **Weight Initialization**: Proper weight initialization can help combat the issue. The idea is to initialize the weights in such a way that the variance remains the same for $x$ and $y$ throughout the network.

3. **Batch Normalization**: Batch normalization is a technique for improving the performance and stability of artificial neural networks. It normalizes the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations.

4. **LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)**: These are special kinds of RNNs which have gating units that modulate the flow of information in the network. These gating units can learn to keep the information for long periods and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

5. **Residual Networks (ResNets)**: ResNets introduce a so-called “identity shortcut connection” that skips one or more layers. This helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by allowing gradients to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers.
