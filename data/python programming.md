# Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.

Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## Features of Python

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution, which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

## Applications of Python

Python is a general-purpose coding language, which means it can be used for nearly everything. Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format at runtime.

Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling:

- Web and Internet Development: Python offers many choices for web development. Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid. Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle. Advanced content management systems like Plone and django CMS.

- Scientific and Numeric: Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing. SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering. Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library.

- Education: Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.

- Desktop GUIs: The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.

- Software Development: Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.

## Conclusion

Python is a powerful, flexible, open-source language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and has powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. For over a decade, Python has been used in scientific computing and highly quantitative domains such as finance, oil and gas, physics, and signal processing.
