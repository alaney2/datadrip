# Deep Learning for Differential Equations

Deep Learning for Differential Equations is a rapidly growing field that aims to combine the power of Deep Learning (DL) with the understanding of Differential Equations (DEs). The main idea behind this is to use DL to learn a Differential Equation from data instead of explicitly solving it.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks (NNs) are the backbone of Deep Learning. They are a class of models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. NNs are made up of layers of interconnected nodes that perform simple computations. The output of one layer is the input to the next layer until the final output is produced. NNs can be used to model complex non-linear relationships in data.

## Partial Differential Equations

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are equations that involve partial derivatives of unknown functions. They are used to model a wide range of physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. Solving PDEs is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of mathematics and physics.

## Ordinary Differential Equations

Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are equations that involve derivatives of unknown functions with respect to a single independent variable. ODEs are used to model a wide range of physical phenomena such as motion, population dynamics, and chemical reactions. Solving ODEs is a fundamental problem in mathematics and engineering.

## Neural ODE Networks

Neural ODE Networks (NODEs) are a class of models that use Neural Networks to learn a Differential Equation. NODEs are based on the idea that a Neural Network can be thought of as a Continuous-Time Dynamical System. By integrating the dynamics of the system, NODEs can learn the solution to the Differential Equation. NODEs have been shown to be effective at solving a wide range of problems, including image classification, time series prediction, and physical simulation.

## Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of models that use Neural Networks to learn a Differential Equation while incorporating physical laws and constraints. PINNs are based on the idea that a Differential Equation can be thought of as a Physical Law. By incorporating this knowledge into the training process, PINNs can learn the solution to the Differential Equation while satisfying the Physical Law. PINNs have been shown to be effective at solving a wide range of problems, including fluid dynamics, acoustics, and structural mechanics.

## Deep Equilibrium Models

Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are a class of models that use Deep Learning to learn an equation that defines an equilibrium state. DEQs are based on the idea that many physical systems can be thought of as being in equilibrium. By learning the equation that defines the equilibrium state, DEQs can solve a wide range of problems, including image denoising, image restoration, and image super-resolution.

In conclusion, Deep Learning for Differential Equations is an exciting field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and engineering. By combining the power of Deep Learning with the understanding of Differential Equations, researchers are able to solve complex problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable.
