# Inception V4 and Inception-ResNet

Inception V4 and Inception-ResNet are two deep convolutional neural network architectures for image classification tasks, introduced by Szegedy et al. in their 2016 paper, "Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning." These architectures build upon the previous Inception models (Inception V1, V2, and V3) and incorporate residual connections, inspired by the success of Residual Networks (ResNets).

## Inception V4

Inception V4 is an evolution of the Inception V3 architecture, with several improvements to increase the model's accuracy and reduce computational complexity. The main changes in Inception V4 include:

1. The use of a stem module at the beginning of the network, which consists of a series of convolutional, pooling, and normalization layers. This stem module helps to reduce the computational complexity of the network and improve its performance.

2. The introduction of Inception-A, Inception-B, and Inception-C modules, which are designed to capture different levels of abstraction in the input images. These modules consist of various combinations of convolutional, pooling, and normalization layers, and are connected in a hierarchical manner.

3. The use of a reduction module between the Inception modules, which helps to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and further decrease the computational complexity of the network.

4. The replacement of the fully connected layers at the end of the network with global average pooling, which reduces the number of parameters in the model and helps to prevent overfitting.

The Inception V4 architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 80.2% and a top-5 accuracy of 95.2%.

## Inception-ResNet

Inception-ResNet is a hybrid architecture that combines the Inception modules with residual connections, inspired by the success of Residual Networks (ResNets). The main idea behind Inception-ResNet is to add residual connections to the Inception modules, which helps to improve the gradient flow during backpropagation and enables the training of deeper networks.

There are two variants of Inception-ResNet: Inception-ResNet-V1 and Inception-ResNet-V2. Both variants use the same Inception modules as Inception V4, but with the addition of residual connections. The main differences between the two variants are the number of layers and the placement of the residual connections.

Inception-ResNet-V1 has a similar depth to Inception V4, with 48 layers, while Inception-ResNet-V2 is deeper, with 71 layers. In Inception-ResNet-V1, the residual connections are added after the Inception-A and Inception-B modules, while in Inception-ResNet-V2, the residual connections are added after the Inception-A, Inception-B, and Inception-C modules.

Both Inception-ResNet variants achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset, with Inception-ResNet-V1 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.1% and a top-5 accuracy of 95.1%, and Inception-ResNet-V2 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.4% and a top-5 accuracy of 95.3%.

## Conclusion

Inception V4 and Inception-ResNet are powerful deep convolutional neural network architectures for image classification tasks, which build upon the previous Inception models and incorporate residual connections. These architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset and have been widely used in various computer vision applications, such as object detection, segmentation, and image captioning.
