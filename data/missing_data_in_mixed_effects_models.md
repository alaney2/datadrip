# Missing Data in Mixed Effects Models

Missing data is a common issue in statistical analysis and can lead to biased or inefficient estimates if not handled properly. Mixed effects models, also known as multilevel or hierarchical models, are a class of statistical models that account for both fixed and random effects. In this article, we will discuss the problem of missing data in mixed effects models and some methods to handle it.

## Types of Missing Data

There are three main types of missing data:

1. **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**: The probability of a data point being missing is independent of both the observed and unobserved data. In this case, the missing data does not introduce any bias in the analysis.

2. **Missing at Random (MAR)**: The probability of a data point being missing depends on the observed data but not on the unobserved data. In this case, the missing data may introduce bias in the analysis, but this bias can be addressed by incorporating the observed data in the imputation process.

3. **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)**: The probability of a data point being missing depends on the unobserved data. In this case, the missing data introduces bias in the analysis, and it is challenging to address this bias without making strong assumptions about the missing data mechanism.

## Handling Missing Data in Mixed Effects Models

There are several methods to handle missing data in mixed effects models, including:

### 1. Complete Case Analysis

Complete case analysis, also known as listwise deletion, involves removing all cases with missing data from the analysis. This method is straightforward to implement but can lead to biased estimates if the data is not MCAR. Moreover, it can result in a significant loss of information if a large proportion of the data is missing.

### 2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a statistical method that estimates the parameters of a model by maximizing the likelihood function. In mixed effects models, MLE can be used to handle missing data under the MAR assumption. The likelihood function incorporates the observed data and the missing data mechanism, allowing for unbiased estimation of the model parameters. However, MLE can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets and complex models.

### 3. Multiple Imputation

Multiple imputation is a method that involves creating multiple copies of the dataset, each with the missing data imputed using a suitable imputation method. The imputed datasets are then analyzed separately, and the results are combined to obtain a single estimate and standard error. Multiple imputation can handle missing data under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased estimates of the model parameters. However, it can be computationally intensive and requires the selection of an appropriate imputation method.

### 4. Bayesian Methods

Bayesian methods involve specifying a prior distribution for the model parameters and updating this distribution using the observed data to obtain a posterior distribution. In mixed effects models, Bayesian methods can be used to handle missing data under the MAR assumption by incorporating the missing data mechanism in the prior distribution. This approach allows for the estimation of the model parameters and their uncertainty, but it requires the specification of a suitable prior distribution and can be computationally intensive.

## Conclusion

Missing data is a common issue in mixed effects models and can lead to biased or inefficient estimates if not handled properly. Several methods can be used to handle missing data, including complete case analysis, maximum likelihood estimation, multiple imputation, and Bayesian methods. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the type of missing data, the assumptions about the missing data mechanism, and the complexity of the model.
