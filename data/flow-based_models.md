# Flow-based Models

Flow-based models are a class of generative models that learn a bijective mapping between the data distribution and a simple, known distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution. These models are designed to capture complex data distributions by transforming a simple distribution through a series of invertible functions. Flow-based models have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to generate high-quality samples and provide tractable likelihood estimation.

## Background

Generative models aim to learn the underlying data distribution of a dataset, allowing them to generate new samples that resemble the training data. There are several types of generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Flow-based models are another type of generative model that have certain advantages over VAEs and GANs, such as exact likelihood computation and more stable training.

The main idea behind flow-based models is to learn a bijective mapping between the data distribution and a simple, known distribution. This is achieved by transforming the simple distribution through a series of invertible functions, called normalizing flows. The invertibility of these functions ensures that the model can generate samples from the data distribution by transforming samples from the simple distribution, and vice versa.

## Normalizing Flows

Normalizing flows are the building blocks of flow-based models. A normalizing flow is an invertible function that transforms a probability distribution into another probability distribution. The key property of normalizing flows is that they preserve the total probability mass, meaning that the transformed distribution has the same total probability as the original distribution.

In the context of flow-based models, normalizing flows are used to transform a simple distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution, into a more complex distribution that resembles the data distribution. This is achieved by composing multiple normalizing flows, each of which transforms the distribution in a specific way.

There are several types of normalizing flows, including planar flows, radial flows, and more recently, Real NVP, Glow, Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF), and Inverse Autoregressive Flows (IAF). Each of these flows has its own unique properties and advantages, but they all share the common goal of transforming a simple distribution into a more complex one.

## Training Flow-based Models

Training a flow-based model involves learning the parameters of the normalizing flows such that the transformed distribution closely matches the data distribution. This is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation, which involves optimizing the likelihood of the training data under the model.

One of the main advantages of flow-based models is that they allow for tractable likelihood computation. This is because the change of variables formula can be used to compute the likelihood of the transformed distribution in terms of the likelihood of the simple distribution and the Jacobian determinant of the normalizing flows. This makes it possible to compute the likelihood of the training data exactly, which is not possible for other generative models like VAEs and GANs.

Another advantage of flow-based models is that they provide more stable training compared to GANs. This is because the training objective is based on likelihood maximization, which is a well-defined optimization problem, as opposed to the min-max game played between the generator and discriminator in GANs.

## Applications

Flow-based models have been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, including image synthesis, speech synthesis, and density estimation. Some notable examples of flow-based models include Real NVP, Glow, MAF, and IAF, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various tasks.

One of the main challenges in developing flow-based models is designing expressive normalizing flows that can capture complex data distributions while maintaining tractable likelihood computation and invertibility. Recent advances in this area have led to the development of more powerful flow-based models that can generate high-quality samples and provide accurate likelihood estimates.

## Conclusion

Flow-based models are a promising class of generative models that learn a bijective mapping between the data distribution and a simple, known distribution. By transforming a simple distribution through a series of invertible normalizing flows, flow-based models can capture complex data distributions and provide tractable likelihood estimation. With their ability to generate high-quality samples and provide stable training, flow-based models have the potential to become a powerful tool in the field of generative modeling.
