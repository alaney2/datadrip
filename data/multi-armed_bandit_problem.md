# Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem is a classic problem in the field of Reinforcement Learning. It is a problem of decision-making under uncertainty, where an agent has to choose between multiple actions (arms) and receive a reward for each action. The goal of the agent is to maximize the total reward over a period of time.

## Problem Statement

The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem is defined as follows: An agent is faced with a row of slot machines (arms), each with a different probability distribution of rewards. The agent has to choose which arm to pull at each time step, and receives a reward based on the probability distribution of the chosen arm. The agent's goal is to maximize the total reward over a period of time.

## Solution Approaches

There are several approaches to solving the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem, including:

### Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm

The Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm is a simple approach to solving the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. It involves choosing the arm with the highest estimated reward with probability 1-epsilon, and choosing a random arm with probability epsilon. This approach balances exploration and exploitation, and can converge to the optimal arm with high probability.

### Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm

The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm is another approach to solving the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. It involves choosing the arm with the highest upper confidence bound, which is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated reward. This approach also balances exploration and exploitation, and can converge to the optimal arm with high probability.
