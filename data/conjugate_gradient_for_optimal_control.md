# Conjugate Gradient For Optimal Control

**Conjugate Gradient For Optimal Control** is a technique used to solve optimal control problems by minimizing the cost function. It is an iterative algorithm that uses conjugate gradient method to find the optimal control input that minimizes the given cost function. This technique is commonly used in various fields such as aerospace, robotics, and economics.

## Optimal Control

**Optimal Control** is a technique used to find the optimal control input that minimizes the cost function over a given time horizon. It is widely used in control theory, economics, and robotics. The optimal control problem can be formulated as follows:

$$
\min_{u(t)} J = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} L(x(t), u(t), t) dt + \phi(x(t_f))
$$

subject to the dynamic constraints:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t)
$$

and the initial condition:

$$
x(t_0) = x_0
$$

where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the control input, $t$ is the time, $L(x(t), u(t), t)$ is the instantaneous cost function, $\phi(x(t_f))$ is the terminal cost function, and $f(x(t), u(t), t)$ is the dynamic model of the system.

## Gradient Descent

**Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent. It is commonly used in machine learning and optimization. The algorithm starts at an initial point and calculates the gradient of the function at that point. It then moves in the direction of the negative gradient by a step size determined by a learning rate. The algorithm repeats this process until it reaches the minimum of the function.

## Conjugate Gradient Method

**Conjugate Gradient Method** is an optimization algorithm used to solve linear systems of equations. It is commonly used in numerical analysis and mathematical optimization. The algorithm starts at an initial guess and iteratively improves the solution by conjugate directions. The conjugate directions are chosen in such a way that they are orthogonal to each other. The algorithm terminates when the residual error is below a certain threshold.
