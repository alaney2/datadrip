# Steepest Descent Method

The steepest descent method, also known as the gradient descent with line search, is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum value of a function. This method is particularly useful when the function is non-linear and does not have a closed-form solution. The steepest descent method is widely used in machine learning, deep learning, and optimization problems.

## Algorithm

The steepest descent method is an iterative algorithm that starts with an initial guess of the minimum value of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the gradient of the function at the current point, which gives the direction of the steepest descent. The algorithm then moves in the direction of the steepest descent by taking a step size that minimizes the function along that direction. The step size is determined by a line search algorithm that uses a backtracking technique to ensure that the function decreases in each iteration. The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a small change in the function value.

The steepest descent method can be summarized as:

1. Initialize the starting point $x_0$ and set the iteration counter $k=0$.
2. Compute the gradient of the function at the current point $x_k$: $\nabla f(x_k)$.
3. Compute the step size $\alpha_k$ along the direction of steepest descent: $\alpha_k = \arg\min\limits_{\alpha>0} f(x_k - \alpha\nabla f(x_k))$.
4. Update the current point: $x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha_k\nabla f(x_k)$.
5. If a stopping criterion is met, terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, set $k=k+1$ and go to step 2.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The steepest descent method is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm that can handle a wide range of non-linear optimization problems. It does not require the computation of the Hessian matrix, which can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems. However, the steepest descent method has several disadvantages that limit its performance. One of the main limitations is the slow convergence rate, especially for ill-conditioned problems. The steepest descent method can also suffer from oscillations and zig-zags if the step size is too large or too small. Moreover, the method is sensitive to the choice of the initial guess and the line search algorithm.

## Applications

The steepest descent method is widely used in machine learning and deep learning to optimize the parameters of a model. It can be used to minimize the cost function of a neural network, which is typically non-linear and high-dimensional. The steepest descent method is also used in image processing, signal processing, and control systems to optimize the performance of a system. In addition, the steepest descent method can be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems in economics, finance, and engineering.
