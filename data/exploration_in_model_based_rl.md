# Exploration in Model-Based RL

Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to the process of discovering new and potentially better policies by exploring the environment. In Model-Based RL, the agent learns a model of the environment and uses it to plan its actions. Exploration is crucial in Model-Based RL because the agent's model may not be perfect, and the agent needs to explore to learn more about the environment.

## Exploration vs Exploitation

Exploration and exploitation are two fundamental concepts in RL. Exploitation refers to the process of using the current knowledge to maximize the expected reward. Exploration, on the other hand, refers to the process of gathering new information to improve the current knowledge. In Model-Based RL, exploration is particularly important because the agent's model may not be perfect, and the agent needs to explore to learn more about the environment.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a popular algorithm for exploration in RL. MCTS is a tree-based search algorithm that builds a search tree by simulating the environment. At each step, MCTS selects the action that maximizes the expected reward, taking into account the uncertainty in the agent's model. MCTS has been successfully applied to a wide range of RL problems, including games such as Go and Chess.

## Thompson Sampling

Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian algorithm for exploration in RL. Thompson Sampling maintains a probability distribution over the possible models of the environment and selects actions based on the expected reward under each model. Thompson Sampling has been shown to be effective in a wide range of RL problems, including online advertising and recommendation systems.

## UCB Algorithm

The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a popular algorithm for exploration in RL. UCB maintains an upper confidence bound on the expected reward of each action and selects the action with the highest upper confidence bound. UCB has been shown to be effective in a wide range of RL problems, including bandit problems and online advertising.

In conclusion, exploration is a crucial component of Model-Based RL. Monte Carlo Tree Search, Thompson Sampling, and UCB are popular algorithms for exploration in RL. These algorithms have been shown to be effective in a wide range of RL problems and are widely used in practice.
