# Regularization

Regularization is a technique in machine learning used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature, thus preventing it from fitting the noise in the data.

## Overfitting

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where the model fits the training data too well, thus losing its ability to generalize to new data. This usually happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of data available. Regularization is one way to combat overfitting.

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning. Regularization can be incorporated into the loss function by adding a penalty term to the gradient.

## Types of Regularization

There are several types of regularization, including L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout regularization.

### L1 Regularization

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights. This has the effect of driving some of the weights to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

### L2 Regularization

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights. This has the effect of shrinking the weights towards zero, effectively reducing the impact of each feature.

### Dropout Regularization

Dropout regularization is a technique where some of the neurons in the model are randomly dropped out during training. This has the effect of preventing any one neuron from becoming too important, thus reducing overfitting.

Regularization is an important technique in machine learning for preventing overfitting and improving the generalization of the model. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, the model is discouraged from fitting to noise in the data, leading to better performance on new data.
