# Multilayer Perceptrons

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of nodes, each processing information through a non-linear activation function. MLPs are widely used in machine learning for various tasks such as classification and regression.

## Architecture

The architecture of an MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains multiple neurons, also known as nodes, which take input values, apply weights to these inputs, and then pass the weighted sum through an activation function. The output of each neuron in a layer is then fed as input to every neuron in the next layer.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the MLP. Some commonly used activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (rectified linear unit), and tanh (hyperbolic tangent).

## Training

The training of an MLP involves adjusting the weights of the connections between the neurons to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This is typically done using the backpropagation algorithm, which involves computing the error at the output layer and then propagating it backwards through the network to adjust the weights.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

One advantage of MLPs is that they can learn non-linear relationships between the input and output data, making them useful for complex tasks such as image recognition. However, they can also be prone to overfitting if the model is too complex or the amount of training data is insufficient.

## Applications

MLPs have been used in various applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modelling.

$$\text{Output}_i = f\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{i,j}x_j + b_i\right)$$

Where $\text{Output}_i$ is the output of neuron $i$; $f$ is the activation function; $w_{i,j}$ is the weight of the connection between neuron $i$ and input $j$; $x_j$ is the input value of neuron $j$; $b_i$ is the bias term for neuron $i$; and $n$ is the number of inputs.
