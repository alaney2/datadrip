# Real Numbers

Real numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics. They are the set of numbers that can be expressed as a decimal, including rational and irrational numbers. Real numbers can be represented on a number line, where each point corresponds to a unique real number.

## Properties of Real Numbers

Real numbers have a number of important properties. They are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. That is, if two real numbers are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, the result is always a real number. Real numbers are also associative, commutative, and distributive under these operations.

Real numbers can be ordered, which means that any two real numbers can be compared. This ordering is preserved under addition and multiplication. For example, if a and b are real numbers and a < b, then a + c < b + c for any real number c.

Real numbers also have the least upper bound property. This means that any non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound, which is also a real number. For example, the set {x ∈ ℝ | x < 5} has a least upper bound of 5. This property is important in analysis and is the basis of the completeness axiom.

## Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Examples of irrational numbers include √2, π, and e. Irrational numbers are important in mathematics because they are ubiquitous and cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal.

## Conclusion

Real numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics and underlie many important mathematical concepts. They are a powerful tool for describing the world around us and have many interesting properties that make them a fascinating subject of study.
