# Adversarial Reprogramming

Adversarial reprogramming is a technique used in adversarial machine learning to change the behavior of a pre-trained machine learning model by incorporating adversarial perturbations. One of the main applications of adversarial reprogramming is to modify the behavior of a pre-trained model to perform a new, desired task. 

## Background

Adversarial reprogramming works by adding a new set of input-output pairs to the training set of the pre-trained model. The new inputs are carefully crafted by an adversary to incorporate adversarial perturbations, which are small, imperceptible changes to the input that cause the model to behave in a certain way. The outputs for the new inputs are chosen by the adversary to correspond to the desired behavior of the model.

## Methodology

Adversarial reprogramming involves four steps:

1. **Model selection**: Select a pre-trained model that is suitable for the desired task.
2. **Input selection**: Choose a set of new inputs that incorporate adversarial perturbations to the pre-trained model. These inputs should correspond to the desired behavior of the model.
3. **Output selection**: Choose a set of corresponding outputs for the new inputs that correspond to the desired behavior of the model.
4. **Training**: Train a new model using the pre-trained model and the new input-output pairs.

## Applications

Adversarial reprogramming has been used in a variety of applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. For example, adversarial reprogramming has been used to modify the behavior of a pre-trained machine learning model to perform a new, desired task, such as answering questions in natural language processing or detecting objects in computer vision.

## Limitations

Adversarial reprogramming has some limitations. One limitation is that the adversary needs to have access to the pre-trained model and its training data. Another limitation is that the adversary needs to have knowledge of the model's architecture and training algorithm. Additionally, adversarial reprogramming can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.
