# Conjugate Gradient For Sparse Matrices

The Conjugate Gradient method is an iterative algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. It is a popular choice for solving large sparse linear systems since it requires less memory and computation time than direct methods.

When dealing with sparse matrices, the Conjugate Gradient method can be further optimized by taking advantage of the sparsity structure of the matrix. Sparse matrices are matrices that have a large number of zero entries, and as such, storing and manipulating these matrices can be computationally expensive. 

The Conjugate Gradient method for sparse matrices involves computing a sequence of vectors that converge to the solution of the linear system. At each iteration, the algorithm computes a search direction that is conjugate to all previous search directions. This ensures that the algorithm searches the solution space efficiently and avoids revisiting the same solution space. 

The algorithm is initialized with an initial guess of the solution, x_0. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the residual vector, r_i=b-Ax_i, where b is the right-hand side of the linear system and A is the sparse matrix. The algorithm then computes the search direction, p_i, which is conjugate to all previous search directions. The search direction is computed as follows:

$$p_i=r_i+\beta_ip_{i-1}$$

where 

$$\beta_i=\frac{r_i^Tr_i}{r_{i-1}^Tr_{i-1}}$$

After computing the search direction, the algorithm computes the step size, Î±_i, which minimizes the residual along the search direction:

$$\alpha_i=\frac{r_i^Tr_i}{p_i^TAp_i}$$

The algorithm then updates the solution:

$$x_{i+1}=x_i+\alpha_ip_i$$

The algorithm iterates until a convergence criterion is met. A common convergence criterion is when the residual norm falls below a certain tolerance level.

Overall, the Conjugate Gradient method for sparse matrices is an efficient and effective way to solve large sparse linear systems. However, it may not always converge, especially if the matrix is poorly conditioned. In such cases, preconditioning techniques can be used to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm.
