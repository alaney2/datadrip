# Integration

In mathematics, **integration** is the process of finding the integral of a given function. It is the inverse operation of differentiation. Integration involves finding the area under the curve of a function between two points on the x-axis. It is an important concept in calculus and has numerous applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics.

## Prerequisites

Before understanding integration, one needs to be familiar with the following concepts:

- **Differentiation**: The process of finding the derivative of a function.
- **Limits**: The value that a function approaches as the independent variable approaches a certain value.
- **Derivatives**: The rate at which a function changes.

## Methods of Integration

There are several methods of integration, some of which are:

### Definite Integration

Definite integration involves finding the value of the integral of a function between two given limits. It is denoted by $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$. The value of the definite integral represents the area under the curve of the function between the two limits.

### Indefinite Integration

Indefinite integration involves finding the general antiderivative of a function. It is denoted by $\int f(x) dx$. It represents a family of functions whose derivative is equal to the given function.

### Integration by Substitution

Integration by substitution is a method used to simplify the integrand by replacing a variable with another. It is useful when the integrand consists of a composite function.

### Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is a method used to integrate the product of two functions. It involves splitting the integrand into two parts and integrating one part while differentiating the other.

### Partial Fraction Decomposition

Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to simplify a rational function into simpler fractions. It is useful when integrating functions that are in the form of a rational function.
