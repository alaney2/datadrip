# Abstract Algebra

**Abstract algebra** is a branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, which are sets of elements with operations that satisfy certain axioms. These structures include groups, rings, fields, and modules.

## Groups

A **group** is a set of elements with a binary operation that satisfies four axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverse. Groups are important in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as symmetry, geometry, and topology. Some of the topics studied in group theory include subgroups, cosets, normal subgroups, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and group actions.

## Rings

A **ring** is a set of elements with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy several axioms. Rings are used in many areas of mathematics, such as number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Some of the topics studied in ring theory include ideals, modules, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and polynomial rings.

## Fields

A **field** is a ring in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Fields are important in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry, coding theory, and Galois theory. Some of the topics studied in field theory include algebraic extensions, transcendental extensions, splitting fields, and Galois groups.

## Further Readings

- **Galois Theory**: Galois theory is a branch of algebra that studies the Galois group of a field extension, which is a group that encodes the automorphisms of the extension that fix the base field. Galois theory has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and quantum mechanics.
- **Homological Algebra**: Homological algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies homology and cohomology, which are algebraic invariants that measure the topological properties of spaces. Homological algebra has applications in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and representation theory.
