# Expectation Maximization Algorithm

The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a statistical method often used for maximum likelihood estimation in cases where the data is incomplete or contains latent variables. It is an iterative process, consisting of two steps: the Expectation step (E-step) and the Maximization step (M-step). The algorithm repeatedly refines parameter estimates until convergence is reached, or a stopping criterion is met.

## Overview

The EM algorithm was introduced in the 1970s by Arthur Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin. The method has been widely adopted in various fields, including machine learning, data mining, and computer vision.

### E-step

In the E-step, the algorithm computes the expected value of the log-likelihood function, given the current estimates of the parameters. This is achieved by calculating the conditional expectation of the complete data log-likelihood, given the observed data and current parameter estimates.

### M-step

In the M-step, the algorithm maximizes the expected log-likelihood computed in the E-step with respect to the parameters. This results in updated parameter estimates, which are then used in the next iteration of the E-step.

## Convergence

The EM algorithm converges to a local maximum of the likelihood function. However, it is sensitive to the initial choice of parameters and may converge to different solutions depending on the starting point. To alleviate this issue, multiple runs with different initializations can be performed, and the solution with the highest likelihood can be selected.

## Applications

The EM algorithm has been applied to a variety of problems, such as mixture model estimation, hidden Markov models, and image segmentation. It is also an essential component of some clustering algorithms, like the Gaussian Mixture Model.

## Limitations

Despite its usefulness, the EM algorithm has several limitations. The convergence can be slow, and the algorithm is sensitive to initial parameter values. Moreover, it can get stuck in local maxima, resulting in suboptimal solutions. Finally, the algorithm assumes the model's underlying structure is correct, which may not always be the case.
