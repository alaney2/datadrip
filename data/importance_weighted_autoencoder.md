# Importance Weighted Autoencoder

An **Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE)** is a type of autoencoder that incorporates importance sampling to improve the quality of the latent space representation. It is a modification of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that aims to increase the lower bound on the data likelihood by introducing importance weights.

## Importance Sampling

Importance sampling is a method for estimating the expectation of a function with respect to a probability distribution that is difficult to sample from. The idea is to sample from a different probability distribution that is easier to sample from, while also introducing importance weights that correct for the difference between the two distributions.

## IWAE Architecture

The IWAE architecture is similar to that of the VAE, with the addition of importance weights. It consists of an encoder that maps the input data to a latent space, a decoder that maps the latent space back to the input space, and a loss function that encourages the latent space to be close to a prior distribution. In the IWAE, multiple samples are drawn from the encoder and decoder distributions, and importance weights are calculated for each sample. The final loss function is a weighted average of the individual losses, where the weights are the normalized importance weights.

## Advantages of IWAE

IWAE has the following advantages over VAE:

- **Improved Lower Bound**: The use of importance weights increases the lower bound on the data likelihood, leading to better quality latent space representations.

- **More Accurate Inference**: The use of multiple samples and importance weights provides a more accurate estimate of the posterior distribution, allowing for better inference on the latent space.

- **Better Performance on Small Datasets**: IWAE performs better than VAE on small datasets, where the number of samples is limited, and the use of importance weights helps to make the most of the available samples.
