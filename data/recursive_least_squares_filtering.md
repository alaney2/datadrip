# Recursive Least Squares Filtering

Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filtering is an adaptive filtering technique used in various applications, such as signal processing, control systems, and communication systems. It is based on the least squares method, which aims to minimize the error between the estimated output and the actual output. RLS filtering is particularly useful in situations where the input data is non-stationary, meaning that the statistical properties of the data change over time.

## Least Squares Method

The least squares method is a widely used technique for estimating the parameters of a linear model. Given a set of input-output pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, the goal is to find the parameters $\theta$ that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual outputs $y_i$ and the estimated outputs $\hat{y}_i$:


$$

\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2

$$


In the context of RLS filtering, the input data is typically a time series, and the linear model is a filter with adjustable coefficients. The objective is to find the filter coefficients that minimize the error between the actual output and the filtered output.

## Adaptive Filters

An adaptive filter is a filter whose coefficients can be adjusted to minimize the error between the desired output and the actual output. The main advantage of adaptive filters is their ability to track changes in the input data's statistical properties. This makes them particularly useful in applications where the input data is non-stationary.

There are several algorithms for adjusting the filter coefficients, such as the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. The main difference between these algorithms is the way they update the filter coefficients. The LMS algorithm uses a gradient descent approach, while the RLS algorithm uses a recursive approach based on the least squares method.

## Recursive Least Squares Algorithm

The Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is an adaptive filtering algorithm that updates the filter coefficients recursively to minimize the error between the desired output and the actual output. The main idea behind the RLS algorithm is to use the least squares method to estimate the filter coefficients at each time step, taking into account the previous estimates and the new input-output pair.

The RLS algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the filter coefficients $\theta_0$ and the covariance matrix $P_0$.
2. For each time step $t = 1, 2, \dots, N$:
    a. Compute the Kalman gain $K_t = P_{t-1} x_t^T (x_t P_{t-1} x_t^T + \lambda)^{-1}$, where $x_t$ is the input vector at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is a forgetting factor.
    b. Update the filter coefficients: $\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} + K_t (y_t - x_t^T \theta_{t-1})$, where $y_t$ is the desired output at time $t$.
    c. Update the covariance matrix: $P_t = \frac{1}{\lambda} (P_{t-1} - K_t x_t P_{t-1})$.

The forgetting factor $\lambda$ is a parameter that controls the trade-off between tracking the input data's changes and reducing the estimation error. A larger forgetting factor gives more weight to the past data, while a smaller forgetting factor gives more weight to the recent data.

## Applications

Recursive Least Squares filtering has been used in various applications, such as:

- Signal processing: RLS filtering can be used to remove noise from a signal or to separate signals that have been mixed together.
- Control systems: RLS filtering can be used to estimate the parameters of a system and to design adaptive controllers that can track changes in the system's dynamics.
- Communication systems: RLS filtering can be used to equalize a communication channel, compensating for the channel's distortion and improving the quality of the received signal.

## Conclusion

Recursive Least Squares filtering is an adaptive filtering technique based on the least squares method. It is particularly useful in situations where the input data is non-stationary, as it can track changes in the data's statistical properties. The RLS algorithm updates the filter coefficients recursively, taking into account the previous estimates and the new input-output pair.
