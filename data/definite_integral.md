# Definite Integral

A definite integral is a type of integral that has a specific numerical value. It is a way of calculating the area under a curve between two points on the x-axis. The definite integral is represented by the symbol $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$, where $a$ and $b$ are the limits of integration, $f(x)$ is the function being integrated, and $dx$ represents an infinitesimal change in the x-axis.

## Properties of Definite Integrals

Some of the important properties of definite integrals are:

* **Linearity:** $\int_{a}^{b}(cf(x)+dg(x))dx = c\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx + d\int_{a}^{b}g(x)dx$, where $c$ and $d$ are constants.

* **Additivity:** $\int_{a}^{c}f(x)dx + \int_{c}^{b}f(x)dx = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$

* **Symmetry:** $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = -\int_{b}^{a}f(x)dx$

## Evaluation of Definite Integrals

The value of a definite integral can be calculated using various methods, such as:

### Riemann Sum

A Riemann sum is a method of approximating the area under a curve by dividing it into a finite number of rectangles and then summing their areas. As the number of rectangles approaches infinity, the approximation becomes more accurate and approaches the value of the definite integral. 

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus states that the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ can be calculated by finding an antiderivative of $f(x)$ and evaluating it at the limits of integration, i.e., 

$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$$ 

where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$.

## Applications of Definite Integrals

Definite integrals have various applications in different fields, such as:

* **Physics:** Definite integrals are used to calculate quantities such as work, energy, and momentum.

* **Probability:** The area under a probability density function is equal to 1, and this area can be calculated using a definite integral.

* **Economics:** Definite integrals can be used to calculate the total revenue or cost of a business over a certain period of time.
