# Weight Decay

**Weight Decay** is a regularization technique that is used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize well on unseen data. Weight decay is a commonly used technique in combination with other regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

## How it Works

Weight decay is a technique that adds an additional term to the loss function of a machine learning model. The additional term is the sum of the squares of the weights of the model multiplied by a regularization parameter. The regularization parameter is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned to achieve the best performance of the model. The regularization parameter controls the strength of the regularization. A higher value of the regularization parameter results in stronger regularization.

The loss function of a machine learning model with weight decay can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Original Loss} + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2
$$

where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, $n$ is the total number of weights in the model, and $w_i$ represents the $i^{th}$ weight of the model.

The regularization term in the loss function penalizes large weights. When the weights are large, the regularization term becomes large, and hence the loss function increases. Therefore, the optimization algorithm tries to minimize the loss function by reducing the weights.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The advantages of weight decay are:

- It is a simple and easy-to-implement regularization technique.
- It is computationally efficient and does not require additional resources.

The disadvantages of weight decay are:

- The regularization parameter needs to be tuned to achieve the best performance of the model.
- It may not be effective in preventing overfitting in all cases.

Weight decay is a commonly used technique in combination with other regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
