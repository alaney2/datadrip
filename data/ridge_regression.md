# Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that introduces a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) method in order to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability. The regularization term, also known as the L2 penalty, is added to the loss function and helps to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients, which in turn reduces the model's complexity.

## Introduction

In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals between the observed data points and the predicted values. The OLS method is used to estimate the coefficients of the linear model. However, OLS can suffer from overfitting, especially when the input features are highly correlated (multicollinearity) or when the number of features is large compared to the number of observations. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

Ridge Regression addresses the issue of overfitting by adding a regularization term to the OLS loss function. The regularization term is the L2 norm of the coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter $\lambda$. By adding this term, the model is penalized for having large coefficients, which helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization ability.

## Mathematical Formulation

The Ridge Regression loss function can be written as:


$$

L(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_j^2

$$


where $L(\beta)$ is the loss function, $n$ is the number of observations, $p$ is the number of features, $y_i$ is the observed output, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_j$ are the coefficients, $x_{ij}$ are the input features, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. The first term in the loss function is the OLS loss, and the second term is the L2 regularization term.

The objective of Ridge Regression is to minimize the loss function with respect to the coefficients $\beta_j$. This can be done using various optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or closed-form solutions.

## Regularization Parameter

The regularization parameter $\lambda$ controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. When $\lambda = 0$, Ridge Regression is equivalent to OLS, and when $\lambda$ is large, the coefficients are heavily penalized, resulting in a simpler model. The optimal value of $\lambda$ can be found using techniques such as cross-validation or Bayesian methods.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Ridge Regression has several advantages over OLS:

1. It helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.
2. It can handle multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated features.
3. It can be used for feature selection by setting a threshold on the magnitude of the coefficients.

However, Ridge Regression also has some disadvantages:

1. It introduces an additional hyperparameter, $\lambda$, which needs to be tuned.
2. It does not perform variable selection, as the coefficients are never exactly zero. This can be addressed using Lasso Regression, which uses L1 regularization instead of L2.

## Applications

Ridge Regression can be applied to various regression problems, such as:

1. Predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
2. Forecasting stock prices based on historical data and market indicators.
3. Estimating the effect of marketing campaigns on sales.

In general, Ridge Regression is a useful technique when dealing with linear regression problems that suffer from overfitting or multicollinearity.
