# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed to handle data with grid-like structures, such as images. Inspired by the human visual system, CNNs use convolutional layers to detect local patterns in data, such as edges, textures, and shapes. They have been widely adopted for various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

## Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers form the core building block of CNNs. They apply a series of convolutional filters to the input data, capturing local patterns and spatial relationships. Each filter slides across the input, performing element-wise multiplication followed by a summation operation, generating a feature map.

### Stride and Padding

Stride and padding are two key hyperparameters of convolutional layers. Stride determines the step size taken when sliding the filter across the input, while padding refers to adding extra pixels around the input data to control the output size.

## Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps, making the network less sensitive to small translations and distortions. Common types of pooling include max pooling, average pooling, and global average pooling.

## Activation Functions

CNNs employ non-linear activation functions to introduce non-linearity into the model. Popular activation functions used in CNNs include Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Leaky ReLU, and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU).

## Fully Connected Layers

Fully connected layers, also known as dense layers, are used to map the high-level features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers to the output classes. They perform matrix multiplication followed by an activation function.

## Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique often used in CNNs to prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly deactivates a percentage of neurons in a layer, making the network more robust and less dependent on specific features.

## Applications

CNNs have been successfully applied to a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation.

## Limitations

Despite their success, CNNs have some limitations. They can be computationally expensive, require large amounts of labeled data for training, and may be susceptible to adversarial attacks.
