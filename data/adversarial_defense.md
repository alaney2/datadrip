# Adversarial Defense

Adversarial Defense refers to the development of techniques to protect machine learning models from adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are input perturbations that are designed to fool the models into making incorrect predictions. Adversarial Defense is an active area of research in machine learning and deep learning.

## Adversarial Attacks

Adversarial attacks are crafted by making small, imperceptible changes to the input data that causes the machine learning model to produce incorrect output. These attacks are designed to exploit a vulnerability in the model's decision boundary. Adversarial attacks can be classified into two categories:

- **White-Box Attacks** - The attacker has full knowledge of the model architecture, parameters and training data.
- **Black-Box Attacks** - The attacker has no knowledge of the model architecture, parameters and training data.

## Adversarial Defense Techniques

There are several techniques that have been developed to defend against adversarial attacks. Some of these techniques are:

- **Adversarial Training** - This technique involves augmenting the training data with adversarial examples. The model is then trained on a mixture of clean and adversarial examples. This helps the model to learn a robust decision boundary that is resilient to adversarial attacks.
- **Defensive Distillation** - This technique involves training a model to mimic the behavior of a pre-trained model. The idea is to make it harder for an attacker to generate adversarial examples, as the attacker would need to bypass two models rather than one.
- **Certified Defense** - This technique involves finding a provable bound on the region of the input space where the model is guaranteed to produce correct outputs. The idea is to make it difficult for an attacker to find an adversarial example within this region.
- **Gradient Masking** - This technique involves adding noise to the gradients during training. This makes it harder for an attacker to craft adversarial examples by perturbing the gradients.

## Conclusion

Adversarial Defense is an important area of research in machine learning and deep learning. Adversarial attacks are a real threat and can cause significant harm if not addressed. There are several techniques that have been developed to defend against adversarial attacks, but the field is still evolving and new techniques are being developed. Adversarial Defense is an active area of research and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.
