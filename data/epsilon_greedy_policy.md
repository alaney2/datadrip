# Epsilon Greedy Policy

Epsilon greedy policy is a widely used algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning. It is a simple yet effective technique that balances exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems and Markov decision processes.

## Overview

In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment to learn an optimal policy that maximizes its long-term cumulative reward. In many scenarios, the agent faces a trade-off between exploiting the actions that it already knows to be good and exploring new actions that may lead to higher rewards in the future. The epsilon greedy policy provides a solution to this exploration-exploitation dilemma.

The epsilon greedy policy is a simple algorithm that chooses an action based on a probability distribution that values exploitation with probability 1-epsilon and exploration with probability epsilon. In other words, with probability 1-epsilon, the algorithm chooses the action that has the highest estimated value according to the current policy. With probability epsilon, the algorithm chooses a random action uniformly from the set of available actions. The value of epsilon is typically set to a small constant such as 0.1 or 0.2.

## Algorithm

The epsilon greedy policy algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the value function Q(s,a) for all state-action pairs.
2. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for a fixed number of episodes or until convergence.
3. With probability 1-epsilon, choose the action that maximizes the value function for the current state.
4. With probability epsilon, choose a random action from the set of available actions.
5. Execute the chosen action and observe the reward and the next state.
6. Update the value function Q(s,a) using the observed reward and the next state.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The epsilon greedy policy has several advantages:

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Guarantees convergence to the optimal policy in the limit of infinite exploration.
- Can be used for both online and batch learning.

However, the epsilon greedy policy also has some disadvantages:

- The value of epsilon needs to be tuned carefully to balance exploration and exploitation.
- The algorithm may get stuck in suboptimal states if the exploration rate is too low or too high.
- The algorithm may suffer from the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional state spaces.
