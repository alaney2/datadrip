# Global Contrast Normalization

Global Contrast Normalization (GCN) is a preprocessing technique used in the field of computer vision, particularly in deep learning applications such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal of GCN is to normalize the contrast of an image, making it easier for the model to learn and extract meaningful features. This is achieved by scaling the pixel intensities of the image so that they have a common mean and standard deviation.

## Motivation

In real-world scenarios, images can have varying contrast levels due to different lighting conditions, camera settings, or post-processing techniques. High contrast images have a wide range of pixel intensities, while low contrast images have a narrow range. These variations in contrast can make it difficult for a model to learn the underlying patterns and features in the data. By applying GCN, the contrast of the images is normalized, making it easier for the model to learn and generalize across different images.

## Algorithm

The Global Contrast Normalization algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Compute the mean pixel intensity of the image.
2. Subtract the mean pixel intensity from each pixel in the image.
3. Compute the standard deviation of the pixel intensities.
4. Divide each pixel intensity by the standard deviation.

Mathematically, the GCN transformation can be represented as:


$$

x_{normalized} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}

$$


where $x$ is the original pixel intensity, $\mu$ is the mean pixel intensity, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the pixel intensities, and $x_{normalized}$ is the normalized pixel intensity.

## Implementation

Here is a simple Python implementation of Global Contrast Normalization using the NumPy library:

```python
import numpy as np

def global_contrast_normalization(image):
    mean_intensity = np.mean(image)
    centered_image = image - mean_intensity
    standard_deviation = np.std(centered_image)
    normalized_image = centered_image / standard_deviation
    return normalized_image
```

## Applications

Global Contrast Normalization is commonly used in deep learning applications, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. By normalizing the contrast of the input images, the model can learn more effectively and generalize better to new images with varying contrast levels.

## Limitations

While GCN is effective in normalizing the global contrast of an image, it does not take into account the local contrast variations within the image. In some cases, this can lead to a loss of important features or details in the image. To address this issue, other preprocessing techniques such as Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) or Whitening Transformations can be used in conjunction with GCN to further improve the model's performance.

## Conclusion

Global Contrast Normalization is a simple yet effective preprocessing technique used in computer vision and deep learning applications to normalize the contrast of images. By scaling the pixel intensities to have a common mean and standard deviation, GCN makes it easier for models to learn and extract meaningful features from the data. However, it is important to consider the limitations of GCN and explore other preprocessing techniques to further improve the model's performance.
