# Q Learning

As I reminisce about the early days of AI and machine learning, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for Q learning. It was one of the first reinforcement learning algorithms that gained prominence in the field of AI. The concept of Q learning is simple but powerful - it learns to make optimal decisions by estimating the expected rewards of each action.

## Introduction

Q learning is a type of model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to solve Markov decision processes (MDP). It is based on the principle of learning from experience, where an agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with the environment. The agent takes actions in the environment and receives a reward for each action. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

Q learning is a value-based method, which means that it learns the value of each state-action pair. The value of a state-action pair represents the expected cumulative reward that the agent will receive if it takes that action in that state and follows the optimal policy thereafter. The optimal policy is the policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

## Learning Algorithm

The Q learning algorithm uses the Bellman equation to estimate the value of each state-action pair. The Bellman equation is a recursive equation that expresses the value of a state as the sum of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the next state. The discount factor is used to reduce the impact of future rewards on the current decision.

The Q learning algorithm updates the value of each state-action pair based on the difference between the expected reward and the actual reward. This difference is called the temporal difference error. The update rule is given by:

$$ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] $$

where:
- $Q(s, a)$ is the value of the state-action pair.
- $s$ is the current state.
- $a$ is the current action.
- $r$ is the immediate reward received for taking action $a$ in state $s$.
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate that controls the rate at which the value function is updated.
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor that controls the importance of future rewards.
- $s'$ is the next state.
- $a'$ is the action taken in the next state.

The Q learning algorithm uses an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. The epsilon-greedy policy chooses the action with the highest value with a probability of $1-\epsilon$ and a random action with a probability of $\epsilon$.

## Practical Applications

Q learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including robotics, game playing, and control systems. One notable application of Q learning is in the field of autonomous driving, where it is used to learn to make driving decisions based on sensor data.
