# On Policy Vs Off Policy

In reinforcement learning, there are two main approaches to learning a policy: on-policy and off-policy. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem at hand.

## On-Policy Learning

On-policy learning involves updating the policy that is used to make decisions while the agent is interacting with the environment. This means that the agent learns from the experiences it has while following the current policy. The most common on-policy learning algorithm is called **SARSA** (State-Action-Reward-State-Action), which updates the Q-values of the current policy.

On-policy learning has the advantage of being more stable than off-policy learning, as the agent is always learning from the same policy that it is using to make decisions. This can be particularly useful in situations where the environment is constantly changing, as the agent can adapt its policy in real-time.

## Off-Policy Learning

Off-policy learning, on the other hand, involves learning from experiences that were generated by a different policy than the one currently being used. The most common off-policy learning algorithm is called **Q-learning**, which updates the Q-values of the optimal policy.

Off-policy learning has the advantage of being more flexible than on-policy learning, as the agent can learn from experiences generated by any policy, not just the one it is currently using. This can be particularly useful in situations where the optimal policy is not known beforehand, as the agent can explore different policies and learn from them.

## Comparison

The choice between on-policy and off-policy learning depends on the specific problem at hand. On-policy learning is generally more stable, but may not be able to explore as effectively as off-policy learning. Off-policy learning is generally more flexible, but may be less stable and more prone to overfitting.

In some cases, a combination of both approaches may be used. For example, **actor-critic methods** combine on-policy learning for the actor (policy) and off-policy learning for the critic (value function).

## Conclusion

On-policy and off-policy learning are two main approaches to learning a policy in reinforcement learning. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem at hand. In some cases, a combination of both approaches may be used to achieve the best results.
