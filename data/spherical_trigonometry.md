# Spherical Trigonometry

Spherical trigonometry is the branch of trigonometry that is concerned with the study of triangles on the surface of a sphere. It has important applications in navigation, geodesy, astronomy, and physics.

## Basics

In spherical trigonometry, all angles are measured in radians and all distances are measured along the surface of a sphere. The sides of a spherical triangle are arcs of great circles, which are the largest circles that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere and pass through its center. The angles of a spherical triangle are the angles between the sides.

The sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is greater than 180 degrees, and can be expressed as:

$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma - \pi = 0$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are the angles of the spherical triangle and $\pi$ is the constant ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

## Laws

Spherical trigonometry has its own set of laws that are analogous to the laws of plane trigonometry. The three main laws are:

### Law of Sines

$$\frac{\sin a}{\sin A} = \frac{\sin b}{\sin B} = \frac{\sin c}{\sin C}$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the arcs opposite the angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

### Law of Cosines

$$\cos a = \cos b \cos c + \sin b \sin c \cos A$$
$$\cos b = \cos a \cos c + \sin a \sin c \cos B$$
$$\cos c = \cos a \cos b + \sin a \sin b \cos C$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the arcs opposite the angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

### Law of Tangents

$$\frac{\tan\frac{a}{2}}{\tan\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{\tan\frac{b}{2}}{\tan\frac{B}{2}} = \frac{\tan\frac{c}{2}}{\tan\frac{C}{2}}$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the arcs opposite the angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

## Applications

Spherical trigonometry has many applications in science and engineering, including:

### Navigation

Spherical trigonometry is used in navigation to calculate the great circle distance between two points on the surface of the Earth, as well as the course and bearing of a ship or aircraft.

### Geodesy

Spherical trigonometry is used in geodesy to calculate the shape and size of the Earth, as well as the positions of points on its surface.

### Astronomy

Spherical trigonometry is used in astronomy to calculate the positions and motions of celestial objects, as well as the distances between them.

### Physics

Spherical trigonometry is used in physics to model the behavior of systems that have spherical symmetry, such as atoms, molecules, and nuclei.
