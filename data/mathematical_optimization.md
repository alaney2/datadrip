# Mathematical Optimization

Mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming, is the process of selecting the best solution to a problem from a set of possible alternatives. It is a field of applied mathematics that is widely used across different industries, including finance, engineering, and computer science.

## Linear Programming

Linear programming is a type of mathematical optimization technique that involves finding the optimal solution to a problem that involves linear relationships. The objective function and constraints must be linear. Linear programming has a wide range of applications, including production planning, transportation planning, and resource allocation.

The standard form of a linear programming problem is:

$$ \text{maximize } \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} $$

$$ \text{subject to } A\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} $$

$$ \text{and } \mathbf{x} \geq 0 $$

where $\mathbf{c}$ is a vector of coefficients, $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of decision variables, $A$ is a matrix of coefficients, and $\mathbf{b}$ is a vector of constants.

## Nonlinear Programming

Nonlinear programming is a type of mathematical optimization technique that involves finding the optimal solution to a problem that involves nonlinear relationships. The objective function and constraints can be nonlinear. Nonlinear programming has a wide range of applications, including portfolio optimization, chemical engineering, and robotics.

The standard form of a nonlinear programming problem is:

$$ \text{minimize } f(\mathbf{x}) $$

$$ \text{subject to } g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0, i = 1,2,\dots,m $$

$$ \text{and } h_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0, j = 1,2,\dots,p $$

where $f(\mathbf{x})$ is the objective function, $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ are the inequality constraints, and $h_j(\mathbf{x})$ are the equality constraints.

## Stochastic Programming

Stochastic programming is a type of mathematical optimization technique that involves finding the optimal solution to a problem that involves uncertain parameters. Stochastic programming has a wide range of applications, including financial risk management, energy planning, and transportation planning.

The standard form of a stochastic programming problem is:

$$ \text{minimize } \mathbb{E}[f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\xi})] $$

$$ \text{subject to } \mathbb{E}[g_i(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\xi})] \leq 0, i = 1,2,\dots,m $$

$$ \text{and } h_j(\mathbf{x}) = 0, j = 1,2,\dots,p $$

where $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\xi})$ is the objective function that depends on $\mathbf{x}$ and a random vector $\mathbf{\xi}$, and $g_i(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\xi})$ are the inequality constraints that depend on $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\xi}$.

## Integer Programming

Integer programming is a type of mathematical optimization technique that involves finding the optimal solution to a problem that involves integer decision variables. Integer programming has a wide range of applications, including production scheduling, network optimization, and facility location.

The standard form of an integer programming problem is:

$$ \text{maximize } \mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} $$

$$ \text{subject to } A\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} $$

$$ \text{and } \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n $$

where $\mathbf{c}$ is a vector of coefficients, $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of decision variables, $A$ is a matrix of coefficients, $\mathbf{b}$ is a vector of constants, and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ means that the decision variables are integers.

## Conclusion

Mathematical optimization is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems across different industries. Linear programming, nonlinear programming, stochastic programming, and integer programming are some of the most commonly used techniques in mathematical optimization. By formulating a problem as a mathematical optimization problem and using the appropriate technique, one can find the optimal solution to the problem.
