# Double Deep Q Networks

Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN) is an extension of the Deep Q Networks (DQN) algorithm, which is used to solve reinforcement learning problems. DDQN was proposed to address the overestimation bias issue in DQN, which can lead to suboptimal policies. This article provides an overview of the DDQN algorithm, its motivation, and its implementation.

## Motivation

In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maps states to actions, maximizing the expected cumulative reward. Q-Learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that estimates the action-value function, also known as the Q-function. The Q-function represents the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in a given state and following a particular policy thereafter.

Deep Q Networks (DQN) is an extension of Q-Learning that uses neural networks to approximate the Q-function. DQN has been successful in solving various reinforcement learning problems, including playing Atari games. However, DQN suffers from overestimation bias, which means that it tends to overestimate the Q-values of certain actions. This overestimation can lead to suboptimal policies, as the agent may choose actions with inflated Q-values instead of the truly optimal actions.

Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN) is an algorithm proposed to address the overestimation bias issue in DQN. The key idea behind DDQN is to use two separate neural networks to decouple the action selection and action evaluation processes, reducing the overestimation of Q-values.

## Algorithm

The DDQN algorithm is based on the Double Q-Learning algorithm, which was originally proposed for tabular Q-Learning. In Double Q-Learning, two separate Q-functions are learned, and the action selection and action evaluation processes are decoupled. This decoupling helps to reduce the overestimation bias.

In DDQN, two neural networks are used to approximate the Q-functions:

1. The online network, which is used for action selection and is updated at each time step.
2. The target network, which is used for action evaluation and is updated less frequently.

The DDQN algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the online network with random weights.
2. Initialize the target network with the same weights as the online network.
3. For each time step:
    a. Select an action using the online network and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
    b. Execute the action in the environment and observe the reward and next state.
    c. Store the transition (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer.
    d. Sample a minibatch of transitions from the replay buffer.
    e. For each transition in the minibatch:
        i. Use the online network to select the best action for the next state.
        ii. Use the target network to evaluate the Q-value of the selected action.
        iii. Compute the target Q-value for the current state and action using the reward and the discounted Q-value of the next state and action.
        iv. Update the online network weights using the computed target Q-value and the current Q-value.
    f. Periodically update the target network weights with the online network weights.

The main difference between DQN and DDQN is the way the target Q-values are computed. In DQN, the target network is used for both action selection and action evaluation, whereas in DDQN, the online network is used for action selection, and the target network is used for action evaluation. This decoupling helps to reduce the overestimation bias and leads to better performance in many reinforcement learning tasks.

## Implementation

Implementing DDQN requires modifying the DQN algorithm to use two separate neural networks for action selection and action evaluation. The main steps to implement DDQN are:

1. Define the neural network architecture for the online and target networks. The architecture can be the same for both networks.
2. Initialize the online and target networks with random weights.
3. Implement the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for action selection using the online network.
4. Implement the experience replay buffer to store and sample transitions.
5. Implement the DDQN update rule, which involves using the online network for action selection and the target network for action evaluation.
6. Periodically update the target network weights with the online network weights.

Several deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, can be used to implement DDQN. There are also many open-source implementations of DDQN available, which can be used as a starting point for custom implementations.

## Conclusion

Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN) is an extension of the Deep Q Networks (DQN) algorithm that addresses the overestimation bias issue in DQN. DDQN uses two separate neural networks to decouple action selection and action evaluation, reducing the overestimation of Q-values and leading to better performance in many reinforcement learning tasks. Implementing DDQN requires modifying the DQN algorithm to use two separate neural networks and updating the target Q-value computation.
