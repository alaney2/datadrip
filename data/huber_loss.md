# Huber Loss

Huber loss is a loss function used in machine learning to calculate the difference between predicted and target values. It is similar to mean squared error but is less sensitive to outliers in the data. 

The Huber loss function is defined as:

$$ L_\delta(y, f(x)) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}(y - f(x))^2 & \text{for } |y - f(x)| \leq \delta \\ \delta(|y - f(x)| - \frac{1}{2}\delta) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Where $y$ is the target value and $f(x)$ is the predicted value. The parameter $\delta$ controls the threshold where the loss function changes from quadratic to linear. 

When the difference between the predicted and target values is smaller than $\delta$, the loss function is quadratic and behaves similarly to mean squared error. However, when the difference is larger than $\delta$, the loss function is linear and behaves similarly to mean absolute error. 

The Huber loss function can be used in a variety of machine learning algorithms, including regression and classification problems. It is particularly useful when the data contains outliers or when the model needs to balance between minimizing the mean squared error and mean absolute error. 

To optimize the loss function, gradient descent can be used just like with mean squared error. The gradient of the Huber loss function with respect to the predicted value is:

$$ \frac{\partial L_\delta(y, f(x))}{\partial f(x)} = \begin{cases} (y - f(x)) & \text{for } |y - f(x)| \leq \delta \\ \delta \text{sign}(y - f(x)) & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

The Huber loss function is related to other loss functions used in machine learning, such as the mean squared error, mean absolute error, and smooth L1 loss. It is often used in conjunction with these other loss functions to improve the performance of machine learning models. 

In summary, Huber loss is a loss function used in machine learning that is less sensitive to outliers than mean squared error. It is useful when the data contains outliers or when the model needs to balance between minimizing the mean squared error and mean absolute error.
