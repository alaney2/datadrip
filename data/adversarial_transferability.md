# Adversarial Transferability

Adversarial transferability is a phenomenon in which adversarial examples generated to fool one machine learning model can also fool other models, even if they have different architectures and were trained on different datasets. In other words, adversarial examples are often transferable across models. 

This phenomenon poses significant challenges to the development of robust machine learning models. It means that attackers can use adversarial examples generated for one model to compromise other models in the same or different domains. Moreover, it implies that the process of developing adversarial defenses that work well across different models is more challenging than previously thought.

## Adversarial Examples

Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that are intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake. These inputs are created by adding small perturbations to the original input data that are imperceptible to humans but can cause the model to misclassify the input. Adversarial examples have been shown to be effective against a wide range of machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and decision trees.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning refers to the process of using knowledge gained from one machine learning task to improve the performance of another task. In the context of adversarial transferability, transfer learning can be used to improve the robustness of a target model by leveraging the knowledge gained from a source model that is more robust to adversarial examples. 

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are commonly used for image and video recognition tasks. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons that are designed to learn features from images. CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, and several defense mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this vulnerability.
