# Statistical Signal Processing

Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) is a subfield of signal processing that deals with the analysis and processing of signals using statistical techniques. SSP is widely used in various fields such as telecommunications, control systems, image processing, speech processing, and biomedical engineering.

## Probability Theory

Probability theory is the foundation of SSP. It provides a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty and randomness in signals. SSP heavily relies on probability theory for modeling and analyzing signals.

## Random Processes

Random processes are used to model signals that vary randomly over time or space. SSP uses random processes to model and analyze signals such as speech and image signals.

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra provides the mathematical tools for analyzing and manipulating signals in a vector space. SSP heavily relies on linear algebra for signal representation and processing.

## Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a powerful tool for analyzing signals in the frequency domain. SSP uses the Fourier transform to analyze the spectral characteristics of signals.

## Spectral Analysis

Spectral analysis is the process of estimating the spectral characteristics of a signal. SSP uses spectral analysis to analyze and process signals in the frequency domain.

## Estimation Theory

Estimation theory deals with the problem of estimating the parameters of a signal or system based on noisy observations. SSP uses estimation theory for signal modeling and parameter estimation.

## Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether a given signal is consistent with a specific hypothesis. SSP uses hypothesis testing to analyze and classify signals.

## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is the process of analyzing signals that vary over time. SSP uses time series analysis to analyze and process signals such as stock prices, weather data, and speech signals.

## Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system based on noisy observations. SSP uses the Kalman filter for signal processing and system identification.

## Wavelets

Wavelets are mathematical functions that are used to analyze signals in both time and frequency domains. SSP uses wavelets for signal denoising, compression, and feature extraction.
