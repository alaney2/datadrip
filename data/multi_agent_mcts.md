# Multi Agent Mcts

Multi Agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MAMCTS) is an extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that is designed for multi-agent systems. MCTS is a popular algorithm for decision-making in single-agent systems, but it can be extended to multi-agent systems by using MAMCTS. 

MAMCTS is a game tree search algorithm that is used to find the optimal action for each agent in a multi-agent system. It works by simulating the game tree for each agent separately and then combining the results to determine the best action for each agent. 

## How it Works

MAMCTS works by simulating the game tree for each agent separately. Each agent has its own MCTS tree that is used to determine the best action for that agent. The trees are updated in parallel, and the results are combined to determine the best action for each agent.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Each agent initializes its own MCTS tree with the current state of the game.

2. Each agent selects an action to take based on the current state of its MCTS tree.

3. The actions are executed simultaneously, and the new state of the game is observed.

4. Each agent updates its MCTS tree with the new state of the game.

5. Steps 2-4 are repeated until a terminal state is reached.

6. The results of each agent's MCTS tree are combined to determine the best action for each agent.

## Advantages

MAMCTS has several advantages over other multi-agent algorithms. 

First, it is a model-free algorithm, which means that it does not require a model of the environment. This makes it more flexible and adaptable to different environments.

Second, it is a distributed algorithm, which means that it can be run on multiple machines in parallel. This makes it scalable and efficient for large-scale multi-agent systems.

Finally, it is a general-purpose algorithm, which means that it can be applied to a wide range of multi-agent problems.

## Applications

MAMCTS has been applied to a variety of multi-agent problems, including:

- RoboCup soccer
- Trading agents
- Multi-robot coordination
- Multi-player games
