# Differentiation

Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus and refers to the process of finding the derivative of a function with respect to its variable. The derivative is a measure of the rate at which the function changes, and it can be used to determine important properties of the function, such as its maximum and minimum values and its concavity.

## Prerequisites

To understand differentiation thoroughly, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Limits**: Limits are used to describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. They are an essential tool for finding derivatives and understanding their properties.
- **Derivatives**: Derivatives are the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. They are the basis for differentiation and provide critical information about the behavior of a function.

## The Derivative

The derivative of a function is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the interval between two points approaches zero. It is usually denoted by the symbol f'(x) or dy/dx. The derivative can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent line to the function at a particular point.

$$ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} $$

The derivative provides important information about the behavior of a function, such as its rate of change, concavity, and critical points. It can be used to find the maximum and minimum values of a function, as well as its inflection points.

## Rules of Differentiation

There are several rules of differentiation that can be used to find the derivative of a function. Some of the most important ones include:

- **Power Rule**: The power rule states that the derivative of a function raised to a constant power is equal to the product of the constant and the function raised to the power minus one.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} $$

- **Product Rule**: The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions is equal to the sum of the product of the first function's derivative and the second function, plus the product of the first function and the second function's derivative.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} (f(x)g(x)) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) $$

- **Quotient Rule**: The quotient rule states that the derivative of the quotient of two functions is equal to the difference of the product of the first function's derivative and the second function, minus the product of the first function and the second function's derivative, all over the square of the second function.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \bigg(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\bigg) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} $$

## Applications of Differentiation

Differentiation has many practical applications in fields such as engineering, physics, and economics. Some of the most common applications include:

- **Optimization**: Derivatives can be used to find the maximum or minimum values of a function, which is important in optimization problems.
- **Related Rates**: Derivatives can be used to find the rate at which one variable changes with respect to another variable.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Marginal analysis is a technique used in economics that involves finding the derivative of a function to determine the change in cost or revenue associated with a small change in the quantity produced or consumed.

## Further Readings

- **Chain Rule**: The chain rule is a rule for finding the derivative of a composite function, which is a function that is formed by combining two or more functions.
- **Implicit Differentiation**: Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of a function that is not expressed in terms of its variable.
- **Partial Differentiation**: Partial differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of a function with respect to one of its variables while treating the other variables as constants.
- **Vector Calculus**: Vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with functions of several variables and their derivatives. It is used extensively in physics and engineering.
