# Hidden Markov Models

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models used to model time series data where the state of the system is hidden and can only be inferred by the observed data. They are widely used in speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, finance, and many other fields.

## Background

HMMs are a type of Markov model where the states of the system are hidden and only the observations are visible. The system is assumed to be a Markov process where the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state and not on the past. The probability of observing a particular sequence of observations given the hidden states is modeled using a likelihood function.

## Model 

An HMM is specified by the following components:

- A set of hidden states, denoted by $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_N\}$.
- A set of observable symbols, denoted by $O = \{o_1, o_2, ..., o_M\}$.
- An initial probability distribution over the hidden states, denoted by $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \{\pi_i\}$, where $\pi_i$ is the probability of starting in state $s_i$.
- A transition probability matrix, denoted by $\mathbf{A} = \{a_{ij}\}$, where $a_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.
- An emission probability matrix, denoted by $\mathbf{B} = \{b_{jk}\}$, where $b_{jk}$ is the probability of observing symbol $o_j$ in state $s_k$.

## Inference

Given the model parameters and a sequence of observations, the goal is to infer the most likely sequence of hidden states that generated the observations. This can be done using the Viterbi algorithm, which is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the most likely path through the state space.

Another common inference task is to compute the probability of observing a particular sequence of observations given the model parameters. This can be done using the forward algorithm or the backward algorithm, which are also dynamic programming algorithms.

## Learning

The parameters of an HMM can be learned from data using the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is a type of Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The Baum-Welch algorithm iteratively computes the expected sufficient statistics of the model given the data and then updates the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the data.

## Extensions

There are many extensions to the basic HMM model, including hidden semi-Markov models, deep hidden Markov models, and hierarchical HMMs. These models allow for more complex dependencies between the hidden states and the observations.

## Conclusion

Hidden Markov Models are a powerful tool for modeling time series data with hidden states. They are widely used in many fields and have many extensions and variations. The Viterbi algorithm, the forward algorithm, and the backward algorithm are used for inference, while the Baum-Welch algorithm is used for learning.
