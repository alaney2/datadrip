# Weighted Cross Entropy Loss

Weighted Cross Entropy Loss is a modification of the standard Cross Entropy Loss used in machine learning and deep learning for classification tasks. It is particularly useful for handling imbalanced datasets, where some classes have significantly more samples than others. By assigning different weights to each class, the loss function can be more sensitive to underrepresented classes, improving the model's performance on these classes.

## Cross Entropy Loss

Before diving into Weighted Cross Entropy Loss, let's briefly review the standard Cross Entropy Loss. Cross Entropy Loss is a widely used loss function for classification tasks, especially in deep learning. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true probability distribution of the target classes. For binary classification, the Cross Entropy Loss can be defined as:


$$

L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]

$$


where $y_i$ is the true label, $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability, and $N$ is the number of samples. For multi-class classification, the Cross Entropy Loss is calculated using the softmax function, which generalizes the binary case to multiple classes.

## Weighted Cross Entropy Loss

Weighted Cross Entropy Loss is an extension of the standard Cross Entropy Loss that incorporates class weights. The idea is to assign a weight to each class, which will be used to scale the contribution of each class to the overall loss. This can help to address the issue of class imbalance, as the model will be more sensitive to underrepresented classes.

The Weighted Cross Entropy Loss for binary classification can be defined as:


$$

L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [w_1 y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + w_2 (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]

$$


where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the weights assigned to the positive and negative classes, respectively. These weights can be chosen based on the inverse of the class frequencies, or they can be tuned as hyperparameters.

For multi-class classification, the Weighted Cross Entropy Loss can be defined as:


$$

L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{C} w_j y_{ij} \log(\hat{y}_{ij})

$$


where $C$ is the number of classes, $y_{ij}$ is the true label for class $j$ in sample $i$, $\hat{y}_{ij}$ is the predicted probability for class $j$ in sample $i$, and $w_j$ is the weight assigned to class $j$.

## Applications

Weighted Cross Entropy Loss is particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset is imbalanced, and some classes have significantly fewer samples than others. In such cases, using the standard Cross Entropy Loss may result in a model that is biased towards the majority class, as the loss function will be dominated by the majority class samples. By incorporating class weights, the Weighted Cross Entropy Loss can help to mitigate this issue and improve the model's performance on underrepresented classes.

Some common applications of Weighted Cross Entropy Loss include:

- Medical image segmentation, where certain anatomical structures or pathological findings may be rare and underrepresented in the dataset.
- Object detection and recognition, where some object classes may be more common than others.
- Text classification, where certain topics or categories may have fewer samples than others.

## Conclusion

Weighted Cross Entropy Loss is a useful modification of the standard Cross Entropy Loss for addressing class imbalance in classification tasks. By incorporating class weights, the loss function can be more sensitive to underrepresented classes, leading to improved model performance on these classes. It is widely used in various applications, such as medical image segmentation, object detection, and text classification.
