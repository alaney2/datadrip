# About Data Drip

Data Drip is a free, comprehensive wiki site focused on providing accessible and up-to-date information on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. The main goal of this platform is to serve as a one-stop knowledge hub for individuals interested in understanding and exploring these rapidly evolving fields.

## AI-Generated Content

All content on the site is generated by large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Using LLMs allows the creation of high-quality, informative wiki pages without needing manual human intervention.

A script runs in the background, automatically generating pages and updating existing ones to ensure that information stays current and relevant. This process is ongoing, and new content is added regularly.

## How to Use

To improve the learning experience, Data Drip offers a left sidebar with prerequisite and further readings for each topic. Users can add these topics to their reading lists, which are stored locally on their devices. Items in the reading list can be rearranged by dragging them, allowing users to tailor their learning paths according to their preferences. Reading lists persist through local storage, making it easy to access pages on future visits. Users can also edit any page to add more information or fix mistakes by going to the page and clicking the "Edit this page" button on the top.
