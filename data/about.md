# About Data Drip

Data Drip is a free, comprehensive wiki site focused on providing accessible and up-to-date information on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. The main goal of this platform is to serve as a one-stop knowledge hub for individuals interested in understanding and exploring these rapidly evolving fields.

## AI-Generated Content

A unique feature of Data Drip is that, except for this About page, all content on the site is generated by advanced language models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Using cutting-edge technology allows the creation of high-quality, informative wiki pages without needing manual human intervention.

A script runs in the background, automatically generating pages and updating existing ones to ensure that information stays current and relevant. This process is ongoing, and new content is added regularly.

## How to Use

To improve the learning experience, Data Drip offers a left sidebar with prerequisite and further readings for each topic. Users can add these topics to their reading lists, which are stored locally on their devices. Items in the reading list can be rearranged by dragging them, allowing users to tailor their learning paths according to their preferences. Reading lists persist through local storage, making it easy to access curated resources during future visits.

## Disclaimer

While GPTs are powerful AI models, they are not perfect. As a result, there may be instances where the generated content contains inaccuracies or is not fully up-to-date. Readers can fix mistakes or add more information to articles by clicking the edit button at the top of each page. Data Drip continuously works on refining its algorithms and improving the overall quality of wiki pages, but users are encouraged to verify any critical information through additional sources.
