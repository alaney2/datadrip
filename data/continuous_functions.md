# Continuous Functions

A continuous function is a function that has no abrupt changes in its graph. In other words, if the input to the function changes slightly, the output changes only slightly as well. This property makes continuous functions important in many fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and economics.

## Definition

A function $f$ is said to be continuous at a point $a$ if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. $f(a)$ is defined.
2. The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ exists.
3. The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is equal to $f(a)$.

A function is said to be continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval.

## Examples

Consider the following functions:

1. $f(x) = x^2$: This function is continuous everywhere.
2. $g(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \mbox{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$: This function is continuous everywhere except at $x=0$.
3. $h(x) = \frac{1}{x}$: This function is continuous on any interval that does not contain $x=0$.

## Properties

Continuous functions have several important properties, including:

1. The intermediate value theorem: If $f$ is continuous on an interval $[a,b]$ and $y$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists a point $c$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(c) = y$.
2. The extreme value theorem: If $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ attains a maximum and a minimum on that interval.
3. Uniform continuity: A function $f$ is uniformly continuous on an interval if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. This property is stronger than ordinary continuity and guarantees that the function does not oscillate too wildly within the interval.

## Applications

Continuous functions are used in a variety of applications, including:

1. Physics: Continuous functions are used to model many physical phenomena, such as motion, sound, and light.
2. Engineering: Continuous functions are used to model the behavior of machines and structures, such as bridges and buildings.
3. Economics: Continuous functions are used to model economic relationships, such as supply and demand curves.

In summary, continuous functions are an important concept in mathematics and have many practical applications in various fields.
