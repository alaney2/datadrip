# Gaussian Process Regression With Missing Data

Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a non-parametric Bayesian approach to regression that provides a flexible and powerful way to model complex functions. It is based on the concept of Gaussian Processes (GPs), which are a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. GPR can be used to model functions with uncertainty, and it is particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.

In this article, we will discuss how to handle missing data in Gaussian Process Regression. Missing data is a common issue in real-world applications, and it can lead to biased or inaccurate estimates if not properly addressed. We will first review the basics of Gaussian Process Regression and then discuss various techniques for dealing with missing data in GPR.

## Gaussian Process Regression

A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. It can be completely specified by its mean function $m(x)$ and covariance function (also called kernel) $k(x, x')$:


$$

f(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))

$$


In Gaussian Process Regression, we are interested in learning a function $f(x)$ that maps input $x$ to output $y$. Given a set of training data $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, we can use GPR to model the function $f(x)$ by conditioning the GP on the observed data:


$$

f(x) | \mathcal{D} \sim \mathcal{GP}(m_{\mathcal{D}}(x), k_{\mathcal{D}}(x, x'))

$$


The mean function $m_{\mathcal{D}}(x)$ and covariance function $k_{\mathcal{D}}(x, x')$ of the conditioned GP can be computed using the kernel function and the observed data. The choice of kernel function is crucial, as it determines the properties of the function $f(x)$, such as smoothness and periodicity.

## Missing Data in Gaussian Process Regression

Missing data can occur in various ways, such as missing input features, missing output values, or missing entire observations. In the context of GPR, we can categorize missing data into two types:

1. **Missing input data**: Some input features are missing for one or more observations. In this case, we can either impute the missing values or modify the kernel function to handle missing data.

2. **Missing output data**: Some output values are missing for one or more observations. In this case, we can treat the missing outputs as latent variables and estimate them using GPR.

### Handling Missing Input Data

When dealing with missing input data, one common approach is to impute the missing values using various techniques, such as mean imputation, regression imputation, or more advanced methods like k-nearest neighbors or matrix factorization. After imputing the missing values, we can apply standard GPR to the complete dataset.

Another approach is to modify the kernel function to handle missing data directly. One such kernel is the "Masked Kernel" proposed by [Ghahramani and Jordan (1994)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1994.6.6.1089), which is defined as:


$$

k_{\text{masked}}(x, x') = k(x \odot m, x' \odot m)

$$


where $k(x, x')$ is the original kernel function, $m$ is a binary mask indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of input features, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. The masked kernel allows us to compute the covariance between two input points with missing data by considering only the observed features.

### Handling Missing Output Data

When dealing with missing output data, we can treat the missing outputs as latent variables and estimate them using GPR. This can be done by extending the standard GPR framework to handle partially observed outputs.

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ be the training data, where $y_i$ is a vector of output values, and some elements of $y_i$ may be missing. We can model the joint distribution of the observed and missing outputs using a multi-output Gaussian Process:


$$

\begin{bmatrix} y_{\text{obs}} \\ y_{\text{mis}} \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{GP} \left( \begin{bmatrix} m_{\text{obs}}(x) \\ m_{\text{mis}}(x) \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} K_{\text{obs,obs}} & K_{\text{obs,mis}} \\ K_{\text{mis,obs}} & K_{\text{mis,mis}} \end{bmatrix} \right)

$$


where $y_{\text{obs}}$ and $y_{\text{mis}}$ are the observed and missing output values, respectively, and $K_{\text{obs,obs}}$, $K_{\text{obs,mis}}$, $K_{\text{mis,obs}}$, and $K_{\text{mis,mis}}$ are the corresponding covariance matrices computed using the multi-output kernel function.

We can then estimate the missing outputs by conditioning the multi-output GP on the observed data:


$$

y_{\text{mis}} | y_{\text{obs}} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( m_{\text{mis|obs}}(x), K_{\text{mis|obs}} \right)

$$


where $m_{\text{mis|obs}}(x)$ and $K_{\text{mis|obs}}$ are the mean and covariance of the conditioned GP, which can be computed using the multi-output kernel function and the observed data.

## Conclusion

Gaussian Process Regression is a powerful and flexible approach to regression that can handle noisy or incomplete data. When dealing with missing data in GPR, we can either impute the missing values or modify the kernel function to handle missing data directly. In the case of missing output data, we can treat the missing outputs as latent variables and estimate them using GPR with a multi-output kernel function.
