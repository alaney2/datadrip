# Feedforward Neural Networks

Feedforward neural networks, also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), are a type of artificial neural network architecture that consist of layers of interconnected neurons. Information flows in a single direction from the input layer to the output layer, passing through one or more hidden layers along the way.

## Architecture

The architecture of a feedforward neural network can be described by the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer.

### Input Layer

The input layer is the first layer of the network, where data is fed into the model. The number of neurons in this layer corresponds to the dimensionality of the input data.

### Hidden Layers

Hidden layers are the intermediate layers between the input and output layers. These layers contain neurons that apply a nonlinear transformation to the data, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and representations.

### Output Layer

The output layer is the final layer of the network, producing the output of the model. The number of neurons in this layer depends on the task being performed, such as the number of classes in a classification problem.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce nonlinearity to the neural network, allowing it to learn complex, nonlinear patterns in the data. Commonly used activation functions include the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions.

## Training Feedforward Neural Networks

Feedforward neural networks are typically trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which is a supervised learning technique that adjusts the weights of the network to minimize a loss function. The algorithm involves two main steps: forward propagation, where the input is passed through the network to generate an output, and backward propagation, where the error between the output and the target is used to update the weights.

## Applications

Feedforward neural networks have been used for a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. However, they have been largely superseded by more advanced neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for many tasks involving large-scale, high-dimensional data.
