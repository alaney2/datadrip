# Proximal Gradient Descent

Proximal gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm used in convex optimization problems. It is an extension of the gradient descent algorithm, which uses a proximal operator to add a regularization term to the objective function. The proximal operator is a function that maps a point to its nearest point in a set, and it is used to enforce constraints on the optimization problem.

The proximal gradient descent algorithm works by taking a step in the negative direction of the gradient of the objective function, and then applying the proximal operator to the result. This results in a new point that is closer to the solution of the optimization problem, and is guaranteed to satisfy any constraints imposed by the proximal operator.

The proximal gradient descent algorithm has several advantages over other optimization algorithms. It is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and can handle large-scale optimization problems. It is also particularly well-suited for problems with sparse solutions, where many of the variables are zero.

One of the key applications of proximal gradient descent is in machine learning, where it is used to solve a variety of optimization problems, including Lasso regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines. It is also used in deep learning, where it is used to optimize the weights and biases of neural networks.

## Prerequisites

To understand proximal gradient descent, it is recommended to have a good understanding of the following topics:

- Gradient descent: an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent.
- Convex optimization: a subfield of optimization that deals with finding the minimum of a convex function.
- Proximal operator: a function that maps a point to its nearest point in a set.
