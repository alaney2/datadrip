# Black Box Variational Inference

Black box variational inference (BBVI) is a scalable and generic approach to approximate Bayesian inference. It is a type of variational inference that aims to make the process of approximating complex posterior distributions more efficient and applicable to a wide range of models. The main idea behind BBVI is to use stochastic optimization techniques and automatic differentiation to perform inference in a "black box" manner, meaning that it can be applied to any model with a differentiable probability density function.

## Background

Bayesian inference is a powerful framework for reasoning under uncertainty, where we update our beliefs about unknown parameters or latent variables given observed data. In many cases, the true posterior distribution of these unknowns is intractable, and we need to resort to approximate inference methods. Variational inference is one such method that frames the problem as an optimization problem, where we try to find the best approximation to the true posterior from a simpler family of distributions.

However, traditional variational inference methods can be limited in their applicability due to the need for model-specific derivations and assumptions about the form of the approximate posterior. This is where black box variational inference comes in, as it aims to overcome these limitations by providing a more general and scalable approach.

## Method

The main idea behind black box variational inference is to use stochastic optimization techniques to optimize the variational objective, also known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The ELBO is given by:


$$

\text{ELBO}(q) = \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z})}[\log p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) - \log q(\mathbf{z})],

$$


where $p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})$ is the joint probability density function of the observed data $\mathbf{x}$ and latent variables $\mathbf{z}$, and $q(\mathbf{z})$ is the variational approximation to the true posterior $p(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x})$. The goal is to find the distribution $q(\mathbf{z})$ that maximizes the ELBO, which is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between $q(\mathbf{z})$ and the true posterior.

To optimize the ELBO using stochastic optimization, we need to compute its gradient with respect to the variational parameters. This is where automatic differentiation comes into play, as it allows us to compute the gradient of the ELBO in a black box manner, without the need for model-specific derivations. The gradient of the ELBO can be estimated using Monte Carlo methods, such as the score function estimator (also known as the REINFORCE estimator) or the reparameterization trick.

The score function estimator is based on the likelihood-ratio trick and is given by:


$$

\nabla_{\theta} \text{ELBO}(q) \approx \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S \nabla_{\theta} \log q(\mathbf{z}^{(s)}; \theta) \left( \log p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}^{(s)}) - \log q(\mathbf{z}^{(s)}; \theta) \right),

$$


where $\theta$ are the variational parameters, and $\mathbf{z}^{(s)}$ are samples from the variational distribution $q(\mathbf{z}; \theta)$. The score function estimator can be used with any differentiable probability density function but can suffer from high variance.

The reparameterization trick, on the other hand, is based on transforming the random variable $\mathbf{z}$ into a deterministic function of a noise variable $\mathbf{\epsilon}$, such that $\mathbf{z} = g(\mathbf{\epsilon}; \theta)$. This allows us to rewrite the gradient of the ELBO as:


$$

\nabla_{\theta} \text{ELBO}(q) \approx \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S \nabla_{\theta} \left( \log p(\mathbf{x}, g(\mathbf{\epsilon}^{(s)}; \theta)) - \log q(g(\mathbf{\epsilon}^{(s)}; \theta); \theta) \right),

$$


where $\mathbf{\epsilon}^{(s)}$ are samples from a fixed noise distribution. The reparameterization trick can lead to lower-variance gradient estimates but is only applicable to certain types of variational distributions.

Once we have an estimate of the gradient of the ELBO, we can use stochastic optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent or adaptive methods like Adam, to update the variational parameters and find the best approximation to the true posterior.

## Applications

Black box variational inference has been applied to a wide range of models and problems in machine learning, including:

- Bayesian neural networks: BBVI can be used to perform approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, allowing for uncertainty quantification and improved generalization.
- Variational autoencoders: BBVI is a key component of variational autoencoders (VAEs), a popular generative model that learns to encode and decode data in an unsupervised manner.
- Gaussian processes: BBVI can be used to scale Gaussian process models to large datasets by approximating the intractable posterior over function values.
- Topic models: BBVI has been applied to Bayesian topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, to learn interpretable representations of text data.

## Limitations and Extensions

While black box variational inference provides a more general and scalable approach to approximate Bayesian inference, it still has some limitations. For example, the choice of the variational family can have a significant impact on the quality of the approximation, and the optimization process can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or the number of Monte Carlo samples.

Several extensions and improvements have been proposed to address these limitations, including:

- Normalizing flows: These are a class of invertible transformations that can be used to construct more flexible variational families, leading to better approximations of the true posterior.
- Amortized inference: This is a technique that leverages neural networks to learn a mapping from the observed data to the variational parameters, allowing for efficient inference in large-scale or hierarchical models.
- Control variates and variance reduction techniques: These methods aim to reduce the variance of the gradient estimates in BBVI, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.

In summary, black box variational inference is a powerful and versatile approach to approximate Bayesian inference that leverages stochastic optimization and automatic differentiation to perform inference in a wide range of models. Despite its limitations, it has been successfully applied to many problems in machine learning and continues to be an active area of research.
