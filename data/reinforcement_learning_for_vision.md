# Reinforcement Learning For Vision

Reinforcement learning for vision is a subfield of deep learning that involves training artificial intelligence (AI) models to learn and make decisions based on visual input. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves teaching an agent how to interact with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal. In the context of vision, this involves training a model to recognize patterns in visual input and make decisions based on that input.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for image processing tasks. CNNs use convolutional layers to extract features from input images, and then use fully connected layers to make predictions based on those features. CNNs are a prerequisite for understanding reinforcement learning for vision, as they are a common choice for image processing in deep learning.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep reinforcement learning is a type of reinforcement learning that uses deep neural networks to learn how to interact with an environment. Deep reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited for vision-based tasks, as it can learn to make decisions based on visual input. Understanding deep reinforcement learning is a prerequisite for understanding reinforcement learning for vision.
