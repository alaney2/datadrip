# Regression Models

Regression models are a class of machine learning algorithms used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. They are widely used in various fields, such as finance, economics, medicine, and engineering, for tasks like predicting stock prices, estimating the impact of marketing campaigns, and forecasting patient outcomes. This article provides an overview of some common regression models, their assumptions, and their applications.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple and widely used regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual target values. The model can be represented as:


$$

y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon

$$


where $y$ is the target variable, $x_i$ are the input features, $\beta_i$ are the model coefficients, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

Linear regression has several assumptions, including linearity, independence of errors, constant variance of errors (homoscedasticity), and normality of errors. Violations of these assumptions can lead to biased or inefficient estimates.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a variation of linear regression used for binary classification problems, where the target variable can take one of two possible values (e.g., 0 or 1). Instead of predicting the target value directly, logistic regression models the probability of the target variable belonging to a certain class. The model can be represented as:


$$

P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n)}}

$$


Logistic regression shares some assumptions with linear regression, such as linearity in the logit and independence of errors. However, it does not assume homoscedasticity or normality of errors.

## Ridge Regression

Ridge regression is a variation of linear regression that introduces a regularization term to the objective function. This term penalizes large coefficients, which can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. The ridge regression model can be represented as:


$$

\min_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_n x_{in}))^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j^2

$$


where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty. Ridge regression assumes the same linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality as linear regression.

## Lasso Regression

Lasso regression is another variation of linear regression that introduces a regularization term, but with a different penalty function. The lasso penalty encourages sparse solutions, meaning that some coefficients may be exactly equal to zero. This can lead to simpler and more interpretable models. The lasso regression model can be represented as:


$$

\min_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_n x_{in}))^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n |\beta_j|

$$


Lasso regression shares the same assumptions as linear and ridge regression.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that allows for non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. This is achieved by including higher-degree terms of the input features in the model. The polynomial regression model can be represented as:


$$

y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \cdots + \beta_n x^n + \epsilon

$$


Polynomial regression assumes the same linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality as linear regression, but with respect to the transformed features.

## Support Vector Regression

Support vector regression (SVR) is a non-linear regression model based on the principles of support vector machines (SVM). SVR aims to find a function that approximates the target variable with a specified tolerance, while minimizing the complexity of the model. The model can be represented as:


$$

y = \sum_{i=1}^n (\alpha_i - \alpha_i^*) K(x_i, x) + b

$$


where $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_i^*$ are the Lagrange multipliers, $K(x_i, x)$ is the kernel function, and $b$ is the bias term. SVR does not make any specific assumptions about the relationship between the input features and the target variable, making it more flexible than linear regression models.

## Decision Tree Regression

Decision tree regression is a non-parametric regression model that recursively partitions the input feature space into regions and fits a constant value within each region. The model can be represented as a tree structure, where each internal node represents a decision rule based on an input feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted target value for a specific region.

Decision tree regression does not make any specific assumptions about the relationship between the input features and the target variable, making it more flexible than linear regression models. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep.

## Random Forest Regression

Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision tree regressors to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the training data, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all trees.

Random forest regression shares the same flexibility as decision tree regression, but with improved generalization performance due to the ensemble approach.
