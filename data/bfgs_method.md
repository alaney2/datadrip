# BFGS Method

The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It belongs to the family of quasi-Newton methods, which are a class of iterative methods for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. 

## Overview

The BFGS method is a type of quasi-Newton method that uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to update the search direction. The Hessian matrix is an important matrix in optimization that describes the curvature of the function being optimized. In the BFGS method, the inverse of the approximate Hessian matrix is used as an approximation of the true Hessian matrix. The BFGS method is a powerful optimization algorithm because it combines the advantages of the Newton method and the steepest descent method.

## Algorithm

The BFGS method starts with an initial estimate of the minimum and iteratively updates it until convergence. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the search direction by multiplying the inverse of the approximate Hessian matrix with the negative gradient of the function. The step size is then determined using a line search algorithm. Finally, the estimate of the minimum is updated using the computed step size and search direction.

The BFGS method has several advantages over other optimization algorithms. It is well suited for high-dimensional problems and is relatively insensitive to the choice of initial estimate. It also has good convergence properties and can handle non-convex objective functions.

## Limitations

Despite its many advantages, the BFGS method has some limitations. It requires the computation and storage of the Hessian matrix, which can be computationally expensive for large problems. It also requires the Hessian matrix to be positive definite, which may not always be the case. In addition, the BFGS method may not converge to the global minimum for non-convex functions.

## Conclusion

The BFGS method is a powerful optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning, deep learning, and other areas of artificial intelligence. It is a quasi-Newton method that uses an approximation of the Hessian matrix to update the search direction. The BFGS method has several advantages over other optimization algorithms, including good convergence properties and the ability to handle non-convex objective functions. However, it also has some limitations, such as the computational expense of computing and storing the Hessian matrix.
