# Tensor Cores

Tensor Cores are a feature provided in NVIDIA's Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPU architectures. They are designed to accelerate matrix operations, which are a fundamental part of deep learning algorithms. Tensor Cores perform mixed-precision matrix multiply and accumulate calculations in a single operation.

## Overview

Tensor Cores are specialized hardware units designed for performing mixed-precision matrix multiplication and accumulation, which are common operations in deep learning. They are capable of performing these operations at a much higher speed compared to traditional GPU cores.

A Tensor Core performs a fused multiply-add (FMA) operation: $D = A * B + C$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are matrices. The input matrices $A$ and $B$ are typically half-precision floating-point (FP16), while the accumulation matrix $C$ and output matrix $D$ can be either half-precision or single-precision (FP32).

## Architecture

Tensor Cores are integrated into the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) of NVIDIA's Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPU architectures. Each Tensor Core provides a 4x4x4 matrix processing array.

In the Volta architecture, each SM contains 8 Tensor Cores. In the Turing and Ampere architectures, each SM contains 4 Tensor Cores. However, the Tensor Cores in Turing and Ampere are capable of performing double the operations per cycle compared to Volta, effectively providing the same throughput.

## Programming with Tensor Cores

Tensor Cores can be programmed using NVIDIA's CUDA programming language. The CUDA libraries cuBLAS (for linear algebra operations) and cuDNN (for deep neural network operations) provide functions that automatically use Tensor Cores when available.

To use Tensor Cores, the matrices must be stored in a specific format known as fragment. A fragment is a structure that holds a portion of a matrix that fits into a Tensor Core. The CUDA Warp Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) API provides functions for loading matrices into fragments, performing the matrix operations, and storing the results.

## Benefits and Limitations

The main benefit of Tensor Cores is their high throughput for matrix operations, which can significantly accelerate deep learning training and inference. They also support mixed-precision training, which can reduce memory usage and further increase speed.

However, Tensor Cores have some limitations. They require the matrices to be a multiple of their processing array size (4x4x4). Also, not all operations in a deep learning algorithm can be accelerated by Tensor Cores. For example, element-wise operations and reductions are still performed by the traditional GPU cores.

Despite these limitations, Tensor Cores have been widely adopted in deep learning due to their significant performance benefits. They are a key feature of NVIDIA's data center GPUs, which are commonly used for deep learning workloads.
