# Quasi-Newton Methods For Sparse Problems

Quasi-Newton methods are a family of optimization algorithms that approximate the Hessian matrix, which contains second-order derivative information, using only first-order derivative information. These methods are particularly useful for problems where computing the exact Hessian matrix is computationally expensive or infeasible, as is the case with many sparse problems. 

Sparse problems are those in which the input data or the solution itself is sparse, meaning that it contains a large number of zero elements. In these cases, the Hessian matrix is also sparse, and computing its inverse or even storing it can be prohibitively expensive. 

One popular quasi-Newton method for sparse problems is the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, which updates the approximation to the Hessian matrix using a rank-two correction formula. Another widely used quasi-Newton method for sparse problems is the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm, which uses a limited amount of memory to store the approximation to the Hessian matrix. 

The Newton-Raphson method is a related optimization algorithm that also makes use of second-order derivative information, but it requires the exact Hessian matrix to be computed at each iteration, making it less suitable for sparse problems. 

Sparse matrices are a key component of many sparse problems, and they are often represented using compressed sparse row (CSR) or compressed sparse column (CSC) formats. These formats allow for efficient storage and manipulation of sparse matrices. 

Some further readings related to quasi-Newton methods for sparse problems include the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, the limited-memory BFGS algorithm, and the conjugate gradient method, which is another popular optimization algorithm for sparse problems.
