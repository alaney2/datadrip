# Mixed Effects Models

Mixed effects models are a type of statistical model used to analyze data with a hierarchical or nested structure. These models are commonly used in fields such as social sciences, biology, and ecology, where data is collected from individuals or groups that are not independent of each other.

## Overview

Mixed effects models, also known as mixed-effects regression or hierarchical models, extend the concept of linear regression to include both fixed and random effects. Fixed effects are variables that are constant across all observations, while random effects are variables that vary across observations and are assumed to be drawn from a population of possible values. In mixed effects models, the fixed effects are modeled using the same linear regression framework as in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, while the random effects are modeled using a distribution that captures the variation between observations.

Mixed effects models are particularly useful when analyzing data with a hierarchical structure, such as repeated measures data or longitudinal data. For example, in a study of the effects of a new medication on blood pressure, the data may be collected from multiple patients who are measured at multiple time points. In this case, the patient-level variation is a random effect, while the time-level variation is a fixed effect.

## Formulation

A mixed effects model can be formulated as follows:

$$ y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{ij} + u_i + e_{ij} $$

where $y_{ij}$ is the response variable for the $j$-th observation in group $i$, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are fixed effects coefficients, $x_{ij}$ is the $j$-th observation of the predictor variable for group $i$, $u_i$ is the random effect for group $i$, and $e_{ij}$ is the residual error for the $j$-th observation in group $i$. The random effect $u_i$ is assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma_u^2$, while the residual error $e_{ij}$ is assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma_e^2$.

## Inference

There are several methods for estimating the parameters in mixed effects models, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and Bayesian methods. In MLE and REML, the likelihood function is maximized to obtain estimates of the fixed and random effects coefficients, as well as the variance components. In Bayesian methods, the posterior distribution of the parameters is obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

After fitting the model, hypothesis tests can be conducted to determine the significance of the fixed effects coefficients and the random effects variances. Likelihood ratio tests can be used to compare models with and without random effects, while Wald tests can be used to test the significance of individual fixed effects coefficients.

## Conclusion

Mixed effects models provide a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing data with a hierarchical structure, allowing for both fixed and random effects to be included in the model. By accounting for the variation between groups or individuals, mixed effects models can provide more accurate and reliable estimates of the fixed effects coefficients, as well as a better understanding of the underlying population structure.
