# Differential Geometry

Differential Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of geometry using calculus and linear algebra. It is concerned with the study of curves, surfaces, and other geometric objects using concepts such as derivatives, tangent spaces, and Riemannian metrics.

## Multivariable Calculus

Multivariable calculus is a prerequisite for differential geometry. It is the study of calculus in more than one variable. In this subject, students learn how to differentiate and integrate functions of more than one variable. They also study topics like partial derivatives, gradient, divergence, and curl.

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is another prerequisite for differential geometry. It is the study of linear equations and their representations in vector spaces. In this subject, students learn about matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and linear transformations.

## Manifolds

Manifolds are topological spaces that are locally Euclidean. They are the objects of study in differential geometry. In this subject, students learn about smooth manifolds, tangent spaces, and vector fields. They also study topics like differential forms, Lie groups, and Lie algebras.

## Riemannian Geometry

Riemannian geometry is a further reading in differential geometry. It is the study of manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric, which is a way of measuring distances and angles on the manifold. In this subject, students study topics like geodesics, curvature, and the Jacobi equation.

## Symplectic Geometry

Symplectic geometry is another further reading in differential geometry. It is the study of manifolds equipped with a symplectic form, which is a way of measuring areas on the manifold. In this subject, students study topics like Hamiltonian mechanics, Darboux's theorem, and Floer homology.

## Topology

Topology is a further reading in differential geometry. It is the study of properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching and bending. In this subject, students study topics like homotopy, homology, and cohomology. They also learn about different types of spaces, such as compact spaces, Hausdorff spaces, and manifolds.
