# Gaussian Mixture Model

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. Each Gaussian component represents a cluster, and the mixture model defines the probability distribution over all the data points.

## Overview

GMM is an unsupervised learning technique that is commonly used for clustering, density estimation, and data generation tasks. It is a flexible model that can capture complex data distributions and can be extended to high-dimensional data. GMM assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of K Gaussian distributions, where K is a hyperparameter that needs to be set before model training. The objective of GMM is to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian components and the mixture weights that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

## Mathematics

Let X be a D-dimensional random variable representing the observed data points. The GMM assumes that X is generated by a mixture of K Gaussian distributions:

$$p(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k)$$

where $\pi_k$ is the mixture weight of the k-th Gaussian component, $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x}|\boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k)$ is the Gaussian distribution with mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k$. The mixture weights $\pi_k$ are non-negative and sum to one. The likelihood of the observed data $\{\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2, ..., \boldsymbol{x}_N\}$ is given by:

$$p(\boldsymbol{X}|\boldsymbol{\pi}, \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} p(\boldsymbol{x}_n) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n|\boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k)$$

The goal of GMM is to find the parameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This can be done by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm that alternates between computing the posterior probabilities of the data points belonging to each cluster (E-step) and updating the parameters of the Gaussian components based on the posterior probabilities (M-step).

## Applications

GMM has a wide range of applications in various fields, including:

- **Clustering**: GMM can be used to group similar data points into clusters based on their probability density. Each cluster can be represented by a Gaussian component, and the number of clusters can be determined by setting the hyperparameter K.
- **Density estimation**: GMM can be used to estimate the probability density function of the data, which can be useful for anomaly detection, outlier detection, and data visualization.
- **Data generation**: GMM can be used to generate new data points that follow the same distribution as the observed data. This can be done by sampling from the learned mixture model.
