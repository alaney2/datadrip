# Spectral Theorem

The Spectral Theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that provides a way to decompose a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It states that for any symmetric matrix, there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, and the corresponding eigenvalues are real and non-negative.

## Definition

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ real symmetric matrix. Then, the Spectral Theorem states that there exists an orthonormal basis $\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of eigenvectors of $A$ such that

$$A = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i v_i v_i^T$$

where $\lambda_i$ are the corresponding eigenvalues of $A$.

## Significance

The Spectral Theorem has significant applications in various fields of mathematics, including differential equations, optimization, and quantum mechanics. It is also widely used in machine learning and data analysis, where it can be used for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and regression.

## Proof

The proof of the Spectral Theorem involves showing that a symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix, which can be constructed using the eigenvectors of the matrix. The details of the proof are beyond the scope of this article, but it can be found in many linear algebra textbooks.

## Applications

The Spectral Theorem has many applications in mathematics and its applications to machine learning are significant.

### Dimensionality Reduction

The Spectral Theorem can be used for dimensionality reduction by projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. This technique is called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and is widely used in data analysis and image processing.

### Clustering

The Spectral Theorem can be used for clustering by constructing a similarity matrix of data points and then applying the Spectral Clustering algorithm to the matrix. This technique is used for image segmentation and community detection in social networks.

### Regression

The Spectral Theorem can be used for regression by constructing a kernel matrix of data points and then applying the Ridge Regression algorithm to the matrix. This technique is used for predicting the outcome of a continuous variable based on a set of predictor variables.
