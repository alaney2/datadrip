# EM for Hidden Markov Models

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a powerful technique for estimating the parameters of a statistical model when some of the data is missing or unobserved. In the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), the EM algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters, such as the transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and initial state probabilities, given a set of observed sequences. The EM algorithm for HMMs is also known as the Baum-Welch algorithm.

## Hidden Markov Models

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents a system that transitions between a finite set of hidden states over time. In an HMM, the state of the system is not directly observable, but the output (emission) of each state is observable. The model is characterized by the following components:

1. A set of hidden states $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N\}$.
2. A set of observable emissions $O = \{o_1, o_2, \dots, o_M\}$.
3. A transition probability matrix $A = \{a_{ij}\}$, where $a_{ij} = P(s_{t+1} = s_j | s_t = s_i)$.
4. An emission probability matrix $B = \{b_{ij}\}$, where $b_{ij} = P(o_t = o_j | s_t = s_i)$.
5. An initial state probability vector $\pi = \{\pi_i\}$, where $\pi_i = P(s_1 = s_i)$.

The goal of the EM algorithm for HMMs is to estimate the parameters $A$, $B$, and $\pi$ given a set of observed sequences.

## Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a statistical model when some of the data is missing or unobserved. The algorithm consists of two main steps: the Expectation (E) step and the Maximization (M) step.

1. **Expectation (E) step**: Given the current estimates of the model parameters, compute the expected values of the missing or unobserved data.
2. **Maximization (M) step**: Given the expected values of the missing or unobserved data, update the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

The EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function, but it may not always find the global maximum.

## Baum-Welch Algorithm

The Baum-Welch algorithm is a specific implementation of the EM algorithm for HMMs. It is used to estimate the parameters $A$, $B$, and $\pi$ given a set of observed sequences. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize the model parameters $A$, $B$, and $\pi$ with random values or using domain knowledge.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    a. **E step**: Compute the forward and backward probabilities for each hidden state at each time step using the current estimates of the model parameters.
    b. **M step**: Update the model parameters $A$, $B$, and $\pi$ using the forward and backward probabilities.

The forward and backward probabilities are computed using the Forward-Backward algorithm, which is a dynamic programming technique for efficiently computing the probabilities of the hidden states given the observed emissions.

In the E step, the forward probabilities $\alpha_t(i) = P(o_1, o_2, \dots, o_t, s_t = s_i)$ and the backward probabilities $\beta_t(i) = P(o_{t+1}, o_{t+2}, \dots, o_T | s_t = s_i)$ are computed for each hidden state $s_i$ at each time step $t$. These probabilities are used to compute the expected values of the missing or unobserved data, which are the probabilities of the hidden states and the state transitions given the observed emissions.

In the M step, the model parameters $A$, $B$, and $\pi$ are updated using the expected values of the hidden states and the state transitions. The updated parameters are guaranteed to increase the likelihood of the observed sequences, and the algorithm converges when the likelihood improvement falls below a predefined threshold.

## Applications

The EM algorithm for HMMs has been widely used in various applications, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and finance. Some specific applications include:

- Speech recognition: Estimating the parameters of an HMM that models the acoustic properties of speech sounds.
- Part-of-speech tagging: Estimating the parameters of an HMM that models the syntactic structure of sentences.
- Gene prediction: Estimating the parameters of an HMM that models the structure of genes in DNA sequences.
- Stock price prediction: Estimating the parameters of an HMM that models the dynamics of stock prices.
