# Beam Search

Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that is used in many fields of computer science, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a type of breadth-first search that only keeps track of a predetermined number of best partial solutions at each level in the search tree. This number is referred to as the 'beam width'. 

## Overview

Beam search is a type of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements by storing only the most promising nodes. The algorithm selects a fixed number of best nodes at each level, according to a heuristic function. The less promising nodes are discarded. 

The beam width, which is the number of nodes stored at each level, is a parameter of the algorithm. A larger beam width means more memory requirements but a higher chance of finding an optimal solution. On the other hand, a smaller beam width means less memory requirements but a higher chance of missing the optimal solution.

## Algorithm

The beam search algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the beam with the root node.
2. Expand the nodes in the beam, generating their successors.
3. Evaluate the successors using a heuristic function.
4. Select the best nodes according to the heuristic function, up to the beam width.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a solution is found or all nodes have been expanded.

## Applications

Beam search is used in various applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning, including:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Beam search is used in NLP tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition to find the most likely sequence of words given a sequence of phonemes or a foreign language sentence.
- **Computer Vision**: In computer vision, beam search is used to find the most likely sequence of actions that lead to a target state in a visual scene.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Beam search can be used in reinforcement learning to find the most likely sequence of actions that lead to a goal state in a given environment.

## Limitations

While beam search is an efficient search algorithm, it has some limitations:

- **Local Optima**: Beam search can get stuck in local optima. This is because it only keeps the best nodes at each level, and these may not lead to the global optimum.
- **Beam Width Selection**: The selection of the beam width is critical. A small beam width may lead to a suboptimal solution, while a large beam width may require excessive memory.
- **Incomplete**: Beam search is not guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, unlike breadth-first search or depth-first search.

Despite these limitations, beam search is a powerful tool in many AI and ML applications due to its efficiency and effectiveness.
