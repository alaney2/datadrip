# Optimization Based Meta Learning

Optimization based meta learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning how to learn. It involves designing models that can learn new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with a few training examples.

## Overview

In traditional machine learning, a model is trained on a large dataset for a specific task, and it performs well on that task but poorly on others. This is because the model has learned the specific patterns in the training data, which may not generalize to other tasks. In contrast, meta learning aims to train a model on a variety of tasks such that it can learn a new task from a small amount of data.

Optimization based meta learning is a particular approach to meta learning that focuses on learning the optimization process itself. The goal is to learn an optimizer that can quickly adapt to new tasks. This is achieved by training the model on a variety of tasks and updating the model parameters based on the performance on these tasks.

## Techniques

There are several techniques in optimization based meta learning, including but not limited to:

1. **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)**: This is a popular method in optimization based meta learning. The idea is to find a set of initial parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to good performance on a new task.

2. **Reptile**: This is a simpler variant of MAML that performs a form of stochastic gradient descent on the meta-parameters.

3. **Meta-SGD**: This method extends MAML by learning per-parameter learning rates and initial parameters.

## Applications

Optimization based meta learning has wide applications in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. For example, in reinforcement learning, optimization based meta learning can be used to train agents that can adapt to new environments quickly.

## Challenges

Despite its potential, optimization based meta learning also faces several challenges. One of the main challenges is the requirement of large amounts of data and computational resources. Another challenge is the difficulty in designing appropriate tasks for meta-training.

In conclusion, optimization based meta learning is a promising approach to meta learning that focuses on learning the optimization process itself. It has wide applications and presents several exciting research directions.
