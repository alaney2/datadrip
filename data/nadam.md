# Nadam

Nadam is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update the weights of neural networks. It is an extension of the Adam optimizer, which combines the benefits of two other optimization algorithms, RMSprop and momentum optimization. Nadam stands for "Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation".

## Background

In machine learning, the goal is to find the optimal values of the parameters, or weights, of a neural network that minimize a given cost function. Optimization algorithms are used to update these weights in order to minimize the cost function. Gradient descent is a common optimization algorithm, which involves iteratively updating weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function. However, it can be slow and may get stuck in local minima.

Momentum optimization is an extension of gradient descent that adds a momentum term, which helps the optimizer to continue in the direction of the previous update. RMSprop is another optimization algorithm that scales the learning rate for each weight based on the average of the squared gradients. Adam combines the benefits of momentum optimization and RMSprop, using the momentum term and the scaled learning rate.

## Nadam Algorithm

Nadam is an extension of Adam that adds the Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) method to the algorithm. NAG updates the weights using a lookahead approach, which involves computing the gradient at a point ahead of the current point in the parameter space. This allows the optimizer to take a more accurate step towards the minimum of the cost function.

The Nadam algorithm updates the weights using the following equations:

$$m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) g_t$$

$$v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) g_t^2$$

$$\hat{m_t} = \frac{m_t}{1-\beta_1^t}$$

$$\hat{v_t} = \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t}$$

$$\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}}+\epsilon} (\beta_1 \hat{m_t} + \frac{(1-\beta_1)g_t}{1-\beta_1^t}) + \frac{\eta \beta_1}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}}+\epsilon} (\frac{(1-\beta_1)g_t}{1-\beta_1^t})$$

where:
- $m_t$ and $v_t$ are the first and second moment estimates of the gradients respectively
- $g_t$ is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights at time t
- $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the exponential decay rates for the moment estimates
- $\hat{m_t}$ and $\hat{v_t}$ are the bias-corrected first and second moment estimates respectively
- $\eta$ is the learning rate
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero
- $\theta_t$ is the updated weight at time t

Nadam has been shown to converge faster than Adam on some datasets, especially when the gradients are sparse or noisy. However, it may not always be the best choice, and its performance may depend on the specific dataset and model being used.

## Conclusion

Nadam is an optimization algorithm used to update the weights of neural networks in machine learning. It is an extension of the Adam optimizer, combining the benefits of momentum optimization and RMSprop. Nadam adds the Nesterov accelerated gradient method to Adam, which helps the optimizer take more accurate steps towards the minimum of the cost function. While Nadam has been shown to converge faster than Adam on some datasets, its performance may depend on the specific dataset and model.
