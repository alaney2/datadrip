# Hamming Distance

Hamming distance is a concept in information theory that measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one binary sequence into another. Named after Richard Hamming, it has applications in computer science and telecommunication, particularly in error detection and correction.

## Definition

Given two strings of equal length, the Hamming distance between them is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions needed to change one string into the other.

If $s$ and $t$ are strings of equal length, the Hamming distance, $d(s, t)$, can be defined as:


$$

d(s, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (s_i \neq t_i)

$$


where $s_i$ and $t_i$ are the $i$-th characters of $s$ and $t$ respectively, and $n$ is the length of the strings.

## Properties

The Hamming distance has several important properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: The Hamming distance between any two strings of equal length is always non-negative. This is because it counts the number of differences between the two strings, which cannot be negative.

2. **Symmetry**: The Hamming distance between two strings $s$ and $t$ is the same as the Hamming distance between $t$ and $s$. This is because the number of differences between $s$ and $t$ is the same as the number of differences between $t$ and $s$.

3. **Triangle Inequality**: For any three strings $s$, $t$, and $u$ of equal length, the Hamming distance between $s$ and $t$ is no greater than the Hamming distance between $s$ and $u$ plus the Hamming distance between $u$ and $t$. This property is also known as the triangle inequality.

## Applications

Hamming distance has a wide range of applications, particularly in the fields of computer science and telecommunications. Some of its applications include:

1. **Error detection and correction**: Hamming distance is used in error detection and correction codes, such as Hamming codes. These codes are used to detect and correct errors in data transmission or storage.

2. **Genetic algorithms**: In genetic algorithms, Hamming distance is used to measure the genetic difference between two individuals or solutions.

3. **Information retrieval**: In information retrieval, Hamming distance is used to measure the similarity between two documents or strings. The smaller the Hamming distance, the more similar the two documents or strings are.

4. **Machine learning**: In machine learning, Hamming distance can be used as a distance metric in clustering algorithms, such as k-means clustering.

In conclusion, Hamming distance is a fundamental concept in information theory with a wide range of applications in various fields. Its properties and applications make it a crucial tool in error detection and correction, genetic algorithms, information retrieval, and machine learning.
