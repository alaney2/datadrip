# Group Theory

Group theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of groups, which are sets equipped with a binary operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions, called group axioms, are satisfied. These axioms are closure, associativity, identity, and inverse.

The study of group theory has applications in many areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science, including but not limited to algebraic geometry, number theory, quantum mechanics, and cryptography.

## Group Axioms

A group consists of a set G and a binary operation * that combines any two elements of G to form a third element in G. The four group axioms are:

1. Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation a * b is also in G.
2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, the operation (a * b) * c is equal to a * (b * c).
3. Identity: There exists an element e in G, called the identity element, such that for all a in G, the operation a * e is equal to a and e * a is equal to a.
4. Inverse: For each element a in G, there exists an element b in G, called the inverse of a, such that a * b is equal to the identity element e and b * a is also equal to e.

## Examples of Groups

There are many examples of groups, including:

- The integers under addition
- The nonzero rational numbers under multiplication
- The set of all n x n invertible matrices with real entries under matrix multiplication
- The symmetries of a regular polygon under composition of transformations

## Applications of Group Theory

Group theory has many applications in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Some examples include:

- In algebraic geometry, groups of automorphisms of algebraic varieties are studied.
- In number theory, Galois groups are used to study the properties of algebraic number fields and their extensions.
- In quantum mechanics, symmetry groups are used to classify particles and study their properties.
- In cryptography, the properties of groups of integers modulo a prime are used to design secure encryption algorithms.
