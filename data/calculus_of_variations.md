# Calculus of Variations

Calculus of Variations is a branch of mathematics that deals with optimizing functionals, which are functions that take in another function as input. In other words, the calculus of variations is concerned with finding the function that minimizes or maximizes a certain functional.

## History

Calculus of Variations has its roots in the early 18th century, with the works of Johann Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler. It was later developed further by other mathematicians, including Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Adrien-Marie Legendre, and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Calculus of Variations has found applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics.

## Functionals

A functional is a function that takes in another function as input and outputs a scalar value. For example, consider the functional defined as:

$$ J[y] = \int_a^b F(x,y,y') dx $$

where $y$ is a function of $x$, $a$ and $b$ are constants, $y'$ denotes the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$, and $F(x,y,y')$ is a function of $x$, $y$, and $y'$. In this case, $J[y]$ is a functional that takes in the function $y$ and outputs a scalar value, which is the integral of $F$ over the interval $[a,b]$.

## Euler-Lagrange Equation

The Euler-Lagrange equation is a necessary condition for a function $y$ to be a critical point of a functional $J[y]$. A critical point is a point where the derivative of $J[y]$ with respect to $y$ is zero. The Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} - \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 0 $$

where $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'}$ denotes the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $y'$.

## Applications

Calculus of Variations has found applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics. For example, in physics, it is used to find the path that a particle takes between two points that minimizes the action, which is a functional that depends on the path of the particle. In economics, it is used to find the optimal consumption and production plans that maximize utility or profit.
