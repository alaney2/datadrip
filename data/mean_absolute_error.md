# Mean Absolute Error

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The lower the MAE, the better the model is at predicting the target variable.

## Formula

The formula for MAE is:

$$MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y_i}|$$

Where:
- $n$ is the number of observations
- $y_i$ is the actual value of the target variable for the i-th observation
- $\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted value of the target variable for the i-th observation

## Interpretation

MAE is a scale-dependent metric, meaning that its value depends on the units of the target variable. For example, if the target variable is in dollars, then the MAE will be in dollars as well. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the MAE of models that predict different target variables.

The interpretation of MAE is straightforward. It represents the average absolute error between the predicted values and the actual values. For example, an MAE of 10 means that, on average, the model's predictions are off by 10 units.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

One advantage of MAE is that it is easy to interpret. Its value is in the same units as the target variable, and it represents the average absolute error of the model's predictions.

One disadvantage of MAE is that it gives equal weight to all errors, regardless of their magnitude. This means that outliers have the same impact on the MAE as small errors. Therefore, MAE may not be the best metric to use when the target variable has extreme values or when the model needs to be optimized for a specific range of values.

## Conclusion

MAE is a simple and intuitive metric for evaluating the performance of regression models. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. However, it has its limitations and may not always be the best metric to use. Researchers and practitioners should consider the nature of the data and the goals of the model when choosing an appropriate evaluation metric.
