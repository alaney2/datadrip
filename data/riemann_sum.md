# Riemann Sum

A Riemann sum is a method used in calculus to approximate the area under a curve. It is named after the mathematician Bernhard Riemann and is used to find the definite integral of a function. The Riemann sum is a way to calculate the area under a curve by dividing the area into smaller rectangles and then adding up the areas of each rectangle.

## Definition

The Riemann sum is defined as follows: 

$$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x$$

where:

- $f$ is a function
- $x_i^*$ is a point in the $i$-th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$
- $\Delta x$ is the width of each subinterval
- $n$ is the number of subintervals

## Understanding Riemann Sum

To understand Riemann sum, consider the area under the curve $f(x)$ shown below:

To calculate the area under the curve, we divide it into smaller rectangles and calculate the area of each rectangle. The width of each rectangle is $\Delta x$ and the height is $f(x_i^*)$, where $x_i^*$ is the height of the rectangle. The area of each rectangle is $f(x_i^*)\Delta x$. The Riemann sum is then the sum of the areas of all the rectangles:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x$$

As the number of rectangles increases, the approximation of the area under the curve becomes more accurate.

## Types of Riemann Sum

There are three types of Riemann sum:

### Left Riemann Sum

The left Riemann sum uses the left endpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of each rectangle. The left Riemann sum is given by:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i-1})\Delta x$$

### Right Riemann Sum

The right Riemann sum uses the right endpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of each rectangle. The right Riemann sum is given by:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i})\Delta x$$

### Midpoint Riemann Sum

The midpoint Riemann sum uses the midpoint of each subinterval to determine the height of each rectangle. The midpoint Riemann sum is given by:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n f\left(\frac{x_{i-1}+x_i}{2}\right)\Delta x$$

## Applications

Riemann sum is used in calculus to approximate the area under a curve. It is used to find the definite integral of a function. The Riemann sum is also used in physics to calculate work and fluid flow.
