# Online Monte Carlo Tree Search

Online Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search that is used in decision-making problems with large state spaces. It is a popular algorithm in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the subfields of reinforcement learning and game theory. MCTS is used to find the optimal decision in a given state by simulating the game or problem from that state and selecting the best action based on the results of the simulation.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a decision-making algorithm that is used in problems with large state spaces. It is a heuristic search algorithm that uses random sampling to build a search tree of the game or problem. The algorithm is based on the principle of Monte Carlo simulation, which involves generating random samples to estimate the outcome of a problem. MCTS is used in a variety of applications, including game playing, robotics, and optimization.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with how agents learn to make decisions in an environment. The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, game playing, and control systems.

## Bandit Algorithms

Bandit algorithms are a class of algorithms used in decision-making problems with limited information. The name "bandit" comes from the idea of a slot machine, where a player must decide which machine to play without knowing the payout probabilities. Bandit algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including online advertising, recommendation systems, and clinical trials.

## Upper Confidence Bounds

Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) is a class of algorithms used in decision-making problems with limited information. The UCB algorithm is based on the principle of balancing exploration and exploitation. The algorithm selects the action with the highest upper confidence bound, which is a measure of how uncertain the algorithm is about the value of the action.

## Multi-Armed Bandits

Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) is a class of problems in which a player must decide which arm of a bandit to pull in order to maximize their reward. The problem is similar to a slot machine, where the player must decide which machine to play without knowing the payout probabilities. MAB problems are used in a variety of applications, including online advertising, recommendation systems, and clinical trials.

## Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. The algorithm is based on the principle of bootstrapping, which involves estimating the value of a state based on the estimated value of the next state. TD learning is used in a variety of applications, including robotics, game playing, and control systems.

In conclusion, Online Monte Carlo Tree Search is a powerful algorithm that is used in decision-making problems with large state spaces. It is a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search that is particularly useful in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the subfields of reinforcement learning and game theory. By simulating the game or problem from a given state and selecting the best action based on the results of the simulation, the algorithm is able to find the optimal decision in a given state.
