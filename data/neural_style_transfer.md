# Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique used in deep learning to merge the style of an image with the content of another image. The result is a new image that looks like the content image, but is rendered in the style of the style image. NST has many applications in the art world, such as creating new pieces of art by combining the styles of two artists. It also has practical uses, such as creating new filters for images or even rendering 3D models with a specific style.

## How it works

NST is achieved by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize features in an image. The CNN is trained on two sets of images: a set of content images and a set of style images. The CNN learns to recognize the content and style features in each of these images. Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to merge the content and style features of two different images.

To create a new image using NST, a third image is used as a starting point. This image is called the generated image. The CNN is then used to extract the content features of the generated image and the style features of the style image. The generated image is then adjusted to match the content features of the content image while also matching the style features of the style image. This process is repeated until the generated image matches the desired style and content.

## Applications

NST has many applications in the art world. It can be used to create new pieces of art by combining the styles of two artists. It can also be used in the film industry for special effects or to create new filters for images. 

NST can also be used in practical applications such as rendering 3D models with a specific style. For example, an architect can use NST to render a 3D model of a building with a specific style that matches the surrounding environment.
