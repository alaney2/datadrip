# Continuous Wavelet Transform

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is a mathematical technique used for time-frequency analysis of signals. It is particularly useful for analyzing non-stationary signals, which are signals whose statistical properties change over time. The CWT provides a way to decompose a signal into a set of basis functions called wavelets, which are localized in both time and frequency domains. This allows for a more precise analysis of the signal's frequency content at different time scales.

## Wavelet Theory

Wavelets are mathematical functions that have certain properties, such as being localized in both time and frequency domains, having zero mean, and being orthogonal to their integer translations. The term "wavelet" comes from the fact that these functions resemble small waves with a finite duration. Wavelets are used as basis functions in the CWT to represent a signal in a time-frequency domain.

A wavelet function $\psi(t)$ must satisfy the following admissibility condition:


$$

C_\psi = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{|\hat{\psi}(\omega)|^2}{\omega} d\omega < \infty

$$


where $\hat{\psi}(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the wavelet function $\psi(t)$.

## Time-Frequency Analysis

Time-frequency analysis is a technique used to study the frequency content of a signal as it evolves over time. The most common method for time-frequency analysis is the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which divides the signal into short segments and computes the Fourier transform of each segment. However, the STFT has a fixed time-frequency resolution, which can be problematic for analyzing signals with varying frequency content over time.

The CWT overcomes this limitation by using wavelets as basis functions, which are localized in both time and frequency domains. This allows the CWT to provide a variable time-frequency resolution, making it more suitable for analyzing non-stationary signals.

## Continuous Wavelet Transform Definition

The Continuous Wavelet Transform of a signal $f(t)$ is defined as:


$$

W_f(a, b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|a|}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \psi^*\left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right) dt

$$


where $W_f(a, b)$ is the CWT of the signal $f(t)$, $\psi^*(t)$ is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function $\psi(t)$, $a$ is the scale parameter, and $b$ is the translation parameter.

The scale parameter $a$ controls the dilation or compression of the wavelet function, allowing it to capture different frequency components of the signal. The translation parameter $b$ controls the position of the wavelet function in time, allowing it to capture the signal's frequency content at different time instances.

## Inverse Continuous Wavelet Transform

The Inverse Continuous Wavelet Transform (ICWT) can be used to reconstruct the original signal from its CWT representation. The ICWT is defined as:


$$

f(t) = \frac{1}{C_\psi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} W_f(a, b) \frac{1}{\sqrt{|a|}} \psi\left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right) \frac{da db}{a^2}

$$


where $C_\psi$ is the admissibility constant of the wavelet function $\psi(t)$.

## Applications

The Continuous Wavelet Transform has numerous applications in various fields, such as:

1. Signal processing: CWT can be used for denoising, compression, and feature extraction of signals.
2. Image processing: CWT can be applied to 2D images for edge detection, texture analysis, and image segmentation.
3. Geophysics: CWT is used for analyzing seismic signals and detecting geological features.
4. Biomedical engineering: CWT can be applied to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular disorders.
5. Finance: CWT can be used to analyze financial time series data for detecting trends, patterns, and anomalies.

## Conclusion

The Continuous Wavelet Transform is a powerful mathematical tool for time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals. By using wavelets as basis functions, the CWT provides a variable time-frequency resolution, making it more suitable for analyzing signals with varying frequency content over time. The CWT has numerous applications in various fields, such as signal processing, image processing, geophysics, biomedical engineering, and finance.
