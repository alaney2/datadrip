# Dueling Deep Q Networks

Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN) is an extension of Deep Q Networks (DQN) that aims to improve the performance of the original DQN algorithm in reinforcement learning tasks. The main idea behind DDQN is to separate the estimation of state values and action advantages, which allows the network to learn more efficiently and generalize better to different tasks.

## Background

In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment to learn a policy that maps states to actions to maximize the cumulative reward. Q-learning is a popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an action-value function, also known as the Q-function. The Q-function estimates the expected cumulative reward for taking a specific action in a given state and following a certain policy thereafter.

Deep Q Networks (DQN) is an approach that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function. DQN has been successful in solving various challenging tasks, such as playing Atari games. However, one limitation of DQN is that it estimates the Q-function for each action separately, which can be inefficient and lead to overestimations of the action values.

## Dueling Architecture

Dueling Deep Q Networks address the limitations of DQN by introducing a new architecture that separates the estimation of state values and action advantages. The dueling architecture consists of two streams, one for estimating the state value function $V(s)$ and the other for estimating the action advantage function $A(s, a)$. The state value function represents the expected cumulative reward for being in a particular state, while the action advantage function represents the relative advantage of taking a specific action in a given state.

The dueling architecture can be implemented by modifying the last hidden layer of a standard DQN. Instead of having a single output layer that estimates the Q-function for each action, the dueling architecture splits the last hidden layer into two separate streams. One stream outputs the state value function, and the other stream outputs the action advantage function. The final Q-function is then computed as the sum of the state value function and the action advantage function:


$$

Q(s, a) = V(s) + A(s, a)

$$


However, this formulation is not unique, as any constant can be added to the state value function and subtracted from the action advantage function without changing the Q-function. To address this issue, the authors of DDQN propose to subtract the mean action advantage from the action advantage function:


$$

Q(s, a) = V(s) + (A(s, a) - \frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a'} A(s, a'))

$$


This modification ensures that the action advantage function has zero mean for each state, which helps to stabilize the learning process.

## Advantages of Dueling Deep Q Networks

Dueling Deep Q Networks have several advantages over the original DQN:

1. **Efficiency**: By separating the estimation of state values and action advantages, DDQN can learn more efficiently. In many tasks, the state value function changes more slowly than the action advantage function, so learning the state value function separately can help the network to generalize better across different actions.

2. **Stability**: The modified Q-function formulation, which subtracts the mean action advantage, helps to stabilize the learning process and reduce the overestimation of action values.

3. **Scalability**: DDQN can be easily combined with other improvements of DQN, such as Double DQN and Prioritized Experience Replay, to further enhance the performance of the algorithm.

## Conclusion

Dueling Deep Q Networks is an important extension of Deep Q Networks that improves the performance of the original DQN algorithm in reinforcement learning tasks. By separating the estimation of state values and action advantages, DDQN can learn more efficiently, generalize better, and provide more stable learning. The dueling architecture can be easily combined with other DQN improvements to create more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.
