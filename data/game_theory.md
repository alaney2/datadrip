# Game Theory

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies decision-making in situations where multiple individuals or entities are involved. It provides a framework for analyzing the behavior of rational agents in strategic interactions, where the outcome of each agent's decision depends on the decisions of others.

Game theory has applications in various fields, including economics, political science, psychology, biology, and computer science. It is used to model and analyze a wide range of phenomena, such as market competition, voting systems, bargaining, social dilemmas, and military conflicts.

## Nash Equilibrium

One of the central concepts in game theory is the Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, who introduced it in his seminal paper "Non-Cooperative Games" in 1950. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

For example, consider the classic game of Prisoner's Dilemma, where two suspects are arrested and interrogated separately. If both confess, they each get a moderate sentence. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free while the other gets a harsh sentence. If both remain silent, they each get a light sentence.

The Nash equilibrium of this game is for both suspects to confess, even though it leads to a worse outcome for both than if they both remained silent. This is because each suspect has an incentive to confess, regardless of what the other does, as confessing always yields a higher payoff than remaining silent.

## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

In some games, there may not be a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player chooses a single strategy with certainty. Instead, there may be a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player randomizes over a set of strategies with certain probabilities.

For example, consider the game of Matching Pennies, where two players simultaneously choose heads or tails. If the choices match, player 1 wins, otherwise player 2 wins. There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, as each player's best response depends on the other's choice. However, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where each player chooses heads and tails with equal probability.

## Dominant Strategy

A dominant strategy is a strategy that yields a higher payoff than any other strategy, regardless of what the other players do. If a player has a dominant strategy, they will always choose it, regardless of what the other players do.

For example, in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, each player has a dominant strategy of choosing their move randomly with equal probability, as this ensures that they cannot be exploited by the other player.
