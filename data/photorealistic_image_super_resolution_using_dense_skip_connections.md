# Photorealistic Image Super Resolution Using Dense Skip Connections

Photorealistic Image Super Resolution (PISR) is a technique in computer vision and deep learning that aims to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs while preserving the photorealistic quality of the output. Dense Skip Connections (DSC) are a type of skip connection used in deep learning models to improve the flow of information and gradients between layers. In this context, PISR using DSC refers to the application of dense skip connections in deep learning models for image super-resolution tasks.

## Image Super Resolution

Image Super Resolution (ISR) is the process of increasing the spatial resolution of an image, i.e., converting a low-resolution image into a high-resolution one. This is an essential task in various applications, such as surveillance, medical imaging, and satellite imaging. Traditional ISR methods include interpolation techniques, such as bicubic interpolation and Lanczos resampling. However, these methods often produce blurry and unrealistic images due to the lack of high-frequency details.

With the advent of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for ISR tasks. These models learn a mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images by minimizing a pixel-wise loss function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). However, optimizing for pixel-wise loss may not always result in visually pleasing images, as it does not account for the perceptual quality of the output.

## Photorealistic Image Super Resolution

To address the limitations of traditional ISR methods, researchers have proposed Photorealistic Image Super Resolution (PISR) techniques. PISR aims to generate high-resolution images that not only have a high pixel-wise accuracy but also maintain the photorealistic quality of the output. This is achieved by incorporating perceptual loss functions, such as feature-based losses or adversarial losses, into the optimization process.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for PISR tasks. In this framework, a generator network learns to generate high-resolution images, while a discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and generated images. The generator is trained to minimize the adversarial loss, which encourages the output to be more photorealistic.

## Dense Skip Connections

Skip connections are a technique used in deep learning models to improve the flow of information and gradients between layers. They allow the model to bypass one or more layers, creating a direct connection between non-adjacent layers. This helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and enables the training of deeper networks.

Dense Skip Connections (DSC) are a type of skip connection where each layer receives input from all preceding layers. This creates a densely connected network, which has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models in various tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and super-resolution.

## PISR Using Dense Skip Connections

In PISR using DSC, a deep learning model with dense skip connections is employed for the image super-resolution task. The dense connections enable the model to learn more complex and hierarchical features, which can help generate more photorealistic images.

One popular architecture for PISR using DSC is the Dense Super-Resolution Network (DSRN). DSRN consists of multiple dense blocks, each containing several convolutional layers with dense skip connections. The output of each dense block is concatenated with the input, forming a global skip connection. This architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in PISR tasks.

Another approach is to incorporate dense skip connections into existing PISR models, such as the Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network (EDSR) or the Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet). By adding dense connections between the layers, these models can learn more expressive features and generate more photorealistic images.

In summary, Photorealistic Image Super Resolution using Dense Skip Connections is a promising approach for generating high-resolution images with improved perceptual quality. By incorporating dense connections into deep learning models, PISR can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various image super-resolution tasks.
