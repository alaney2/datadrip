# Transformer Networks

Transformer Networks are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in their paper "Attention Is All You Need". This architecture has been widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering.

## Architecture

The Transformer Network architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes an input sequence and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder takes the hidden states and generates an output sequence. Both the encoder and decoder consist of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward neural networks.

The self-attention mechanism allows the network to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each layer. This is done by computing a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights are learned during training. The feedforward neural network is used to transform the output of the self-attention layer.

## Advantages

One of the main advantages of Transformer Networks is their ability to handle variable-length input sequences. This is particularly useful in NLP tasks where the length of the input text can vary greatly. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism allows the network to capture long-range dependencies between words in the input sequence.

## Applications

Transformer Networks have been used in a variety of NLP tasks, including language translation, text summarization, and question answering. One of the most well-known applications of Transformer Networks is the BERT model, which is used for a variety of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.

## Limitations

One limitation of Transformer Networks is their computational complexity. The self-attention mechanism requires computing a weighted sum over all input positions, which can be computationally expensive for long input sequences. Additionally, the large number of parameters in the network can make it difficult to train on small datasets.
