# Ordinal Poisson Regression

Ordinal Poisson Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between an ordinal response variable and one or more predictor variables. It is a combination of Poisson Regression, which models count data, and Ordinal Regression, which models ordinal data. In this context, the response variable is ordinal, meaning it has a natural order but the distances between the categories are not necessarily equal. The predictor variables can be continuous, categorical, or a mix of both.

Ordinal Poisson Regression is a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that uses the Poisson distribution to model the ordinal response variable and a link function to relate the predictor variables to the response variable. The most common link function used in Ordinal Poisson Regression is the log link function, which is also used in standard Poisson Regression.

## Assumptions

Ordinal Poisson Regression makes several assumptions about the data:

1. The response variable is ordinal, with a natural order to the categories.
2. The predictor variables can be continuous, categorical, or a mix of both.
3. The relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable can be modeled using a Poisson distribution and a log link function.
4. The observations are independent of each other.

## Model Formulation

Ordinal Poisson Regression models the relationship between the ordinal response variable $Y$ and the predictor variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ using the following equation:


$$

\log(\lambda_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_p X_{pi}

$$


where $\lambda_i$ is the expected count of the response variable for observation $i$, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p$ are the regression coefficients, and $X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{pi}$ are the predictor variables for observation $i$.

The model can be extended to include multiple ordinal categories by introducing additional intercepts and regression coefficients for each category. For example, if there are $K$ ordinal categories, the model can be written as:


$$

\log(\lambda_{ij}) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} X_{1i} + \beta_{2j} X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_{pj} X_{pi}

$$


where $\lambda_{ij}$ is the expected count of the response variable for observation $i$ in category $j$, and $\beta_{0j}, \beta_{1j}, \beta_{2j}, \dots, \beta_{pj}$ are the intercepts and regression coefficients for category $j$.

## Model Estimation

The parameters of the Ordinal Poisson Regression model are typically estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The likelihood function for the model is given by:


$$

L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^K \frac{e^{-\lambda_{ij}} \lambda_{ij}^{y_{ij}}}{y_{ij}!}

$$


where $y_{ij}$ is the observed count of the response variable for observation $i$ in category $j$, and $\beta$ is the vector of all regression coefficients. The MLE estimates are obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood function:


$$

\log L(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^K \left[ -\lambda_{ij} + y_{ij} \log(\lambda_{ij}) - \log(y_{ij}!) \right]

$$


This optimization problem can be solved using numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm or the Fisher scoring method.

## Model Interpretation

The interpretation of the regression coefficients in Ordinal Poisson Regression is similar to that of standard Poisson Regression. The coefficients represent the change in the log of the expected count of the response variable for a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other predictor variables constant.

For example, if $\beta_1$ is the regression coefficient for predictor variable $X_1$, then a one-unit increase in $X_1$ is associated with a $\beta_1$ change in the log of the expected count of the response variable, holding all other predictor variables constant. To obtain the change in the expected count itself, we can exponentiate the regression coefficient:


$$

\text{Change in expected count} = e^{\beta_1}

$$


## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation for Ordinal Poisson Regression can be done using various goodness-of-fit measures, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), or the deviance. These measures can be used to compare different models and select the best-fitting model for the data.

In addition, the assumptions of the model can be checked using diagnostic plots, such as the Pearson residuals plot or the deviance residuals plot. These plots can help identify potential issues with the model, such as overdispersion or underdispersion, which may indicate that a different model, such as Negative Binomial Regression, might be more appropriate.

## Conclusion

Ordinal Poisson Regression is a useful statistical method for modeling the relationship between an ordinal response variable and one or more predictor variables. It combines the features of Poisson Regression and Ordinal Regression to model count data with an ordinal structure. The model is estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and the interpretation of the regression coefficients is similar to that of standard Poisson Regression. Model evaluation can be done using goodness-of-fit measures and diagnostic plots to ensure that the model is appropriate for the data.
