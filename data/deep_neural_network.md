# Deep Neural Network

A **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship.

## Overview

The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will scan the image (input) through each layer of the network, comparing it to the learned weights of the dogs it has been trained on. It then provides a probability that the dog in the image is the breed it has been trained to recognize.

## Structure

The structure of a DNN is composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons or nodes, hence the name 'deep'. Each layer is connected to its adjacent layers through 'edges'. Nodes in adjacent layers have connections or edges between them. These edges are often assigned 'weights' that are adjusted during training of the neural network.

## Training

Training a DNN involves adjusting the weights of the network to improve the accuracy of the network's predictions. This is done using a process called backpropagation and an optimization technique such as gradient descent. The network is trained by providing it with inputs and desired outputs, and the weights are adjusted to minimize the difference between the network's output and the desired output.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions are a crucial part of deep neural networks. They determine the output of a neural network. Their main purpose is to convert an input signal of a node in a neural network to an output signal. That output signal is used as an input in the next layer in the stack.

## Overfitting and Regularization

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, where a model performs well on training data but does not generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting. These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, which reduces the complexity of the model.

## Applications

Deep neural networks have been used in many applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.

## Conclusion

Deep Neural Networks are a powerful tool in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They have the ability to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which is a common scenario in many real-world data sets. Despite their effectiveness, they are not the solution to every problem. They require a large amount of data and computational resources, and they are not easily interpretable, which can be a disadvantage in certain applications.
