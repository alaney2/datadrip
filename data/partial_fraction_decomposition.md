# Partial Fraction Decomposition

Partial fraction decomposition is a technique used in mathematics to decompose a rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. It is often used in calculus, differential equations, and signal processing, among other areas.

Given a rational function of the form:

$$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials, the goal of partial fraction decomposition is to express $f(x)$ as a sum of simpler fractions. Specifically, the technique involves finding constants $A_i$ and polynomials $B_i$ such that:

$$f(x) = \frac{A_1}{B_1(x)} + \frac{A_2}{B_2(x)} + \cdots + \frac{A_n}{B_n(x)}$$

where $n$ is the degree of the denominator polynomial $Q(x)$.

The process of finding the constants $A_i$ and polynomials $B_i$ involves factoring the denominator polynomial $Q(x)$ and then solving a system of linear equations to determine the values of the constants.

There are several methods for carrying out partial fraction decomposition, including the cover-up method, the method of undetermined coefficients, and the method of residues.

Partial fraction decomposition has applications in a variety of fields. In calculus, it is often used to evaluate integrals involving rational functions. In signal processing, it is used to analyze and design filters. In control theory, it is used to analyze and design controllers.
