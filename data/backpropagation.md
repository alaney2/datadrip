# Backpropagation

Backpropagation is a widely used optimization algorithm for training feedforward artificial neural networks. It is a supervised learning technique that adjusts the weights and biases of the network through a process called gradient descent. Backpropagation works by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each weight by using the chain rule of calculus.

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a given function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent. In the context of neural networks, gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function by updating the weights and biases based on the gradient of the loss function.

### Learning Rate

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size taken during each iteration of gradient descent. A smaller learning rate results in slower convergence, while a larger learning rate may cause the optimization process to overshoot the minimum.

### Batch, Mini-Batch, and Stochastic Gradient Descent

There are three primary variants of gradient descent: batch, mini-batch, and stochastic. Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the entire dataset, while stochastic gradient descent updates the weights and biases based on a single training example. Mini-batch gradient descent lies in between, updating the model using a subset of the training data.

## Chain Rule

The chain rule is a fundamental principle in calculus that allows the calculation of the derivative of a composite function. In backpropagation, the chain rule is used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the neural network.

## Loss Functions

Loss functions measure the difference between the predicted output and the true target. Common loss functions used in backpropagation include mean squared error, cross-entropy, and hinge loss.

## Weight Initialization

Proper weight initialization is crucial for the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm. Popular initialization techniques include Xavier/Glorot initialization and He initialization.

## Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

Vanishing and exploding gradients are problems that can occur during backpropagation in deep neural networks. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become too small to effectively update the weights and biases, while exploding gradients happen when the gradients become too large, causing unstable weight updates.
