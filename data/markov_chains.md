# Markov Chains

Markov chains are mathematical models that describe a system that transitions between different states over time. They are widely used in various fields, including physics, chemistry, economics, and computer science. In artificial intelligence, Markov chains are particularly useful for modeling sequential decision-making problems, such as reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

## Definition

Formally, a Markov chain is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. This property states that the probability of moving from one state to another depends only on the current state and not on the history of the system. In other words, the future state of the system is conditionally independent of the past given the present.

A Markov chain can be represented by a directed graph, where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition between states. The probability of transitioning from state i to state j is given by the transition probability matrix P, where P(i,j) is the probability of going from i to j.

## Stationary Distribution

A stationary distribution is a probability distribution that remains unchanged over time. In a Markov chain, a stationary distribution is reached when the system has reached a steady state, where the probabilities of being in each state do not change over time. The stationary distribution is characterized by the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the transition probability matrix P.

## Applications

Markov chains have numerous applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. One common application is in reinforcement learning, where Markov decision processes are used to model sequential decision-making problems. Another application is in natural language processing, where Markov models are used to generate text, predict the next word in a sentence, or identify named entities.

## Limitations

Despite their usefulness, Markov chains have some limitations. One limitation is that they assume the Markov property, which may not be true in all real-world systems. Another limitation is that they require knowledge of the transition probabilities, which may be difficult to obtain in practice. Finally, Markov chains do not account for long-term dependencies between states, which may be important in certain applications.

## Conclusion

Markov chains are powerful mathematical models that are widely used in various fields, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. They provide a compact representation of a system's dynamics and can be used to make predictions about future states. However, they also have limitations that should be taken into account when applying them to real-world problems.
