# Multi Step Learning

Multi Step Learning is a type of reinforcement learning that involves taking multiple steps to update the value function of an agent. In contrast to single-step methods like Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, multi-step methods take into account multiple future rewards to update the value function. This can lead to faster convergence and better performance in certain scenarios.

## Background

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and receiving rewards, and the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. 

Temporal Difference (TD) Learning is a popular method in RL that updates the value function of an agent based on the difference between the estimated value and the actual reward received. TD Learning is a single-step method, meaning that it only takes into account the immediate reward and the estimated value of the next state. 

Multi Step Learning, on the other hand, takes into account multiple future rewards to update the value function. This can lead to faster convergence and better performance in certain scenarios. Multi Step Learning can be thought of as a generalization of TD Learning, where instead of only considering the immediate reward and next state, the agent considers multiple future rewards and states.

## Methods

There are several methods for implementing Multi Step Learning, including:

- **n-Step TD Learning**: This method updates the value function based on the difference between the estimated value and the actual reward received n steps into the future. This can be thought of as a generalization of TD Learning, where n=1.

- **n-Step SARSA**: This method is similar to n-Step TD Learning, but instead of updating the value function, it updates the Q-function, which estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action in a particular state and following a particular policy.

- **n-Step Q-Learning**: This method is similar to n-Step SARSA, but instead of using the SARSA update rule, it uses the Q-Learning update rule, which takes the maximum expected cumulative reward over all possible actions in the next state.

## Applications

Multi Step Learning has been successfully applied in a variety of domains, including:

- **Game Playing**: Multi Step Learning has been used to train agents to play games like chess, Go, and poker.

- **Robotics**: Multi Step Learning has been used to train robots to perform complex tasks like grasping objects and navigating through environments.

- **Natural Language Processing**: Multi Step Learning has been used to train agents to generate natural language responses to user queries.
