# Probability Distributions

Probability distributions describe the likelihood of outcomes for random variables. They are used extensively in statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to model uncertainties and make predictions. There are numerous types of probability distributions, including discrete and continuous distributions, and each type has its unique properties and applications.

## Discrete Distributions

Discrete probability distributions are used to describe the probabilities of outcomes for discrete random variables, which can take on a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values.

### Bernoulli Distribution

The Bernoulli distribution represents the outcome of a single binary experiment, such as a coin toss. It has a single parameter, the probability of success.

### Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success.

### Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur independently and at a constant rate.

## Continuous Distributions

Continuous probability distributions are used for continuous random variables, which can take on an uncountably infinite number of values within a specified range.

### Uniform Distribution

The uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all values within a given range. It is characterized by two parameters, the lower and upper limits of the range.

### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about its mean. It is characterized by two parameters, the mean and the standard deviation.

### Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process. It is characterized by a single parameter, the rate at which events occur.

### Beta Distribution

The beta distribution is a versatile distribution defined on the interval [0, 1] and is characterized by two positive shape parameters, alpha and beta.

## Multivariate Distributions

Multivariate distributions describe the joint behavior of two or more random variables.

### Multinomial Distribution

The multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution for categorical variables with more than two categories.

### Multivariate Normal Distribution

The multivariate normal distribution is a generalization of the normal distribution to multiple dimensions. It is characterized by a mean vector and a covariance matrix.

## Applications

Probability distributions are crucial for various tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence, such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference.

## Limitations

Selecting an appropriate probability distribution for a given problem can be challenging, and the choice of distribution can significantly impact the results. Incorrect assumptions about the underlying distribution may lead to suboptimal performance and poor predictions.
