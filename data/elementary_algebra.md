# Elementary Algebra

Elementary algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation and solution of equations involving variables and constants. It is considered to be the foundation of algebra and is used extensively in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

## Basic Arithmetic

Before diving into elementary algebra, an understanding of basic arithmetic is necessary. Basic arithmetic covers the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the properties of numbers such as commutativity, associativity, and distributivity.

## Solving Linear Equations

Solving linear equations is a crucial skill in elementary algebra. A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are constants and x is the variable. Solving a linear equation involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation by performing inverse operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Factoring Polynomials

Factoring polynomials is another important topic in elementary algebra. A polynomial is an expression consisting of one or more variables and coefficients, combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Factoring a polynomial involves finding its factors, which are expressions that divide the polynomial exactly.

## Systems of Equations

A system of equations is a set of two or more equations involving the same variables. Solving a system of equations involves finding the values of the variables that satisfy all the equations in the system simultaneously. Systems of equations can be solved using various methods such as substitution, elimination, and graphing.

## Rational Expressions

A rational expression is a fraction in which the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. Simplifying rational expressions involves canceling common factors and performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and x is the variable. Solving a quadratic equation involves finding the values of x that satisfy the equation. Quadratic equations can be solved using various methods such as factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula.

Elementary algebra forms the basis for more advanced topics in algebra such as abstract algebra, linear algebra, and algebraic geometry. It is also used extensively in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.
