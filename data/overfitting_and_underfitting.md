# Overfitting and Underfitting

**Overfitting** and **underfitting** are two common problems in machine learning that occur when a model is too complex or too simple, respectively, for the data it is being trained on. 

**Overfitting** occurs when a model is too complex and starts to learn the noise in the training dataset, rather than the underlying pattern that generalizes to new, unseen data. This can result in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Overfitting can be caused by a model that is too complex, too many features, or too many training iterations. 

**Underfitting** occurs when a model is too simple and does not capture the underlying pattern in the data. The model is not complex enough to learn the relevant features of the data, and thus, it performs poorly on both the training data and new data. Underfitting can be caused by a model that is too simple, too few features, or too few training iterations.

## Bias and Variance Tradeoff

Overfitting and underfitting are closely related to the **bias and variance tradeoff**. Bias refers to the difference between the expected value of the model's predictions and the true values of the data. High bias models are typically too simple and underfit the data. Variance, on the other hand, refers to the sensitivity of the model's predictions to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance models are typically too complex and overfit the data.

## Model Selection

To prevent overfitting and underfitting, it is important to select the right model complexity that balances the bias and variance tradeoff. This can be done through **model selection**, which involves choosing the best model that fits the data. Common techniques for model selection include cross-validation, early stopping, and ensembling.

## Regularization

Another technique to prevent overfitting is **regularization**, which involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and complex models. This helps to simplify the model and prevent it from overfitting the data. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.

## Further Readings

- **Early Stopping**: a technique for preventing overfitting by stopping the training process early when the model starts to overfit the data.
- **Cross-Validation**: a technique for model selection that involves splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data.
- **Ensemble Learning**: a technique for improving model performance by combining multiple models to make predictions.
