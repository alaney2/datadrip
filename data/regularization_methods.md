# Regularization Methods

Regularization methods are techniques used in machine learning and statistics to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Regularization methods help to simplify the model, making it more general and less likely to overfit.

## Overview

Regularization methods work by adding a penalty term to the loss function that the model tries to minimize. This penalty term discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature, helping to prevent overfitting. The amount of regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, which can be tuned to find the best trade-off between bias and variance.

There are several types of regularization methods, including L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and elastic net regularization. These methods differ in the type of penalty they impose on the model's coefficients.

## L1 Regularization

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients. This can result in some coefficients being reduced to zero, effectively excluding the corresponding feature from the model. L1 regularization can therefore be used for feature selection.

## L2 Regularization

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regression, adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This tends to spread the coefficient values out more evenly, resulting in a model that is less sensitive to individual features. L2 regularization does not result in sparse solutions, unlike L1 regularization.

## Elastic Net Regularization

Elastic net regularization is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term that is a mix of the L1 and L2 penalties, controlled by a mixing parameter. Elastic net regularization can be useful when there are multiple correlated features, as it can group them together.

## Regularization in Deep Learning

In deep learning, there are additional regularization methods available, such as dropout and early stopping. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0 at each update during training, which helps prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit.

Regularization is a crucial part of training machine learning models, and understanding how different regularization methods work can help in choosing the right method for a given problem.
