# Epsilon Greedy Algorithm

The Epsilon Greedy Algorithm is a popular exploration-exploitation strategy used in Reinforcement Learning. It is commonly used in the Multi-Armed Bandit problem, where an agent has to choose between multiple actions (arms) with unknown reward distributions. The goal is to maximize the total reward obtained over a certain period of time.

## Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma

The exploration-exploitation dilemma arises when an agent has to choose between exploiting the current best action or exploring other actions to gather more information about their rewards. Exploitation means choosing the action with the highest expected reward based on the current knowledge. Exploration means choosing a non-greedy action to gather more information about its reward distribution.

The Epsilon Greedy Algorithm is a simple and effective way to balance exploration and exploitation. It works by choosing the greedy action with the highest expected reward with probability 1-epsilon, and choosing a non-greedy action with probability epsilon. The value of epsilon determines the degree of exploration. A high value of epsilon leads to more exploration, while a low value of epsilon leads to more exploitation.

## Algorithm

The Epsilon Greedy Algorithm can be described as follows:

1. Initialize the expected reward for each action to 0.
2. Repeat for each time step:
    1. With probability 1-epsilon, choose the action with the highest expected reward.
    2. With probability epsilon, choose a random action.
    3. Observe the reward for the chosen action.
    4. Update the expected reward for the chosen action using the following formula:
        ```
        Q(a) = Q(a) + alpha * (r - Q(a))
        ```
        where Q(a) is the expected reward for action a, alpha is the learning rate, and r is the observed reward.
3. Repeat step 2 for a certain number of time steps.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The Epsilon Greedy Algorithm is a simple and intuitive exploration-exploitation strategy that can be easily implemented in practice. It is also computationally efficient and does not require a lot of memory.

However, the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm has some disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it requires tuning the value of epsilon. A high value of epsilon can lead to too much exploration and a low value of epsilon can lead to too little exploration. Another disadvantage is that it does not take into account the uncertainty in the estimated expected rewards. This can lead to suboptimal decisions in some cases.

## Conclusion

The Epsilon Greedy Algorithm is a popular exploration-exploitation strategy used in Reinforcement Learning. It is a simple and effective way to balance exploration and exploitation in the Multi-Armed Bandit problem. However, it has some disadvantages that need to be taken into account when using it in practice.
