# Parallel Computing

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism.

## Overview

Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). The idea is based on the fact that the process of solving a problem usually involves many, often millions, of calculations.

## Types of Parallelism

There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism.

### Bit-Level Parallelism

Bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word.

### Instruction-Level Parallelism

Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is a measure of how many of the instructions in a computer program can be executed simultaneously. This type of parallelism has been used in various forms in most high-performance computers.

### Data Parallelism

Data parallelism is a form of parallelization across multiple processors in parallel computing environments. It focuses on distributing the data across different nodes, which operate on the data in parallel. It can be applied on regular data structures like arrays and matrices by working on each element in parallel.

### Task Parallelism

Task parallelism (also known as function parallelism and control parallelism) is a form of parallelization of computer code across multiple processors in parallel computing environments. Task parallelism focuses on distributing tasks—concurrently performed by processes or threads—across different processors.

## Parallel Computing Architectures

Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly known as Flynn's taxonomy. According to Flynn's taxonomy, computers are divided into SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data), SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data), and MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) machines.

## Parallel Programming Models

Parallel programming models exist as an abstraction above hardware and memory architectures. They are generally not tied to a specific type of machine or memory architecture. The most common parallel programming models include the shared memory model, the distributed memory model, and the hybrid distributed-shared memory model.

## Conclusion

Parallel computing is a key component of high performance computing and has been instrumental in the development of many complex and computationally intensive tasks. It is an essential tool for modeling, simulation and the analysis of complex systems.
