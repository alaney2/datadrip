# Bayesian Inference

Bayesian Inference is a statistical approach to infer the probability distribution of unknown parameters in a model, given a set of observed data. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability distribution of the parameters is proportional to the likelihood of the data given the parameters and the prior probability distribution of the parameters. 

## Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

where $\theta$ is the vector of unknown parameters, $D$ is the observed data, $P(\theta|D)$ is the posterior probability distribution of $\theta$ given $D$, $P(D|\theta)$ is the likelihood of the data given $\theta$, $P(\theta)$ is the prior probability distribution of $\theta$, and $P(D)$ is the marginal likelihood of the data.

## Posterior Inference

The goal of Bayesian Inference is to compute the posterior probability distribution of the parameters given the observed data. This can be done by using the Bayes' theorem and computing the posterior distribution analytically or numerically. 

### Analytical Methods

Analytical methods for computing the posterior distribution include conjugate priors, which are prior distributions that result in posterior distributions of the same family as the prior. 

### Numerical Methods

Numerical methods for computing the posterior distribution include Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which generate a sequence of samples from the posterior distribution, and Variational Inference (VI) methods, which approximate the posterior distribution with a simpler distribution that is tractable.

## Bayesian Decision Theory

Bayesian Decision Theory is a framework for making decisions based on the posterior distribution of the parameters. It involves selecting the decision that minimizes the expected loss, where the loss function measures the cost of making a wrong decision. 

## Applications

Bayesian Inference has many applications in various fields, such as:

- Finance: estimating the value of financial assets and managing risks
- Engineering: designing experiments and optimizing systems
- Medicine: diagnosing diseases and estimating treatment effects
- Machine Learning: training models with uncertain parameters and selecting hyperparameters
