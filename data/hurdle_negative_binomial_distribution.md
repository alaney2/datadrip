# Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution

The Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is a statistical model used to analyze count data with an excess of zeros. It is a type of zero-inflated model, which is a class of models that account for the presence of extra zeros in the data by combining two separate processes: one generating the zeros and the other generating the positive counts. The Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is specifically designed for overdispersed count data, where the variance is greater than the mean.

## Background

In many real-world applications, count data often exhibit an excess of zeros, which can lead to biased and inefficient estimates when using standard count data models such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions. To address this issue, zero-inflated models were developed, which combine a point mass at zero with a standard count distribution. The Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is one such model, which is particularly useful for overdispersed count data.

## Definition

The Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is defined as a mixture of a Bernoulli distribution and a zero-truncated Negative Binomial distribution. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is given by:


$$

P(Y = y) = \begin{cases}
    \pi + (1 - \pi) \cdot p_0, & \text{if } y = 0 \\
    (1 - \pi) \cdot p_y, & \text{if } y > 0
\end{cases}

$$


where $Y$ is the count variable, $y$ is a non-negative integer, $\pi$ is the probability of a zero count, $p_0$ is the probability of a zero count in the zero-truncated Negative Binomial distribution, and $p_y$ is the probability of a count $y$ in the zero-truncated Negative Binomial distribution.

The zero-truncated Negative Binomial distribution is defined as follows:


$$

p_y = \frac{\Gamma(r + y)}{y! \Gamma(r)} \cdot \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right)^y \cdot \left( 1 - p \right)^r \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \left( 1 - p \right)^r}

$$


where $r > 0$ is the number of failures until the experiment is stopped, $p \in (0, 1)$ is the probability of success, and $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function.

## Estimation

The parameters of the Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or other optimization techniques. The log-likelihood function for the Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is given by:


$$

\ell(\pi, r, p) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log(1 - \pi) + \log p_{y_i} + (1 - y_i) \log(\pi + (1 - \pi) p_0) \right]

$$


where $n$ is the number of observations, and $y_i$ is the $i$-th observation.

## Applications

The Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution has been used in various applications, including:

1. Modeling the number of insurance claims in actuarial science.
2. Analyzing the number of visits to a healthcare provider in health economics.
3. Modeling the number of species in ecological studies.
4. Analyzing the number of citations received by scientific articles in bibliometrics.

## Advantages and Limitations

The main advantage of the Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution is its ability to model overdispersed count data with an excess of zeros. This makes it more flexible and accurate than standard count data models such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions.

However, the Hurdle Negative Binomial Distribution has some limitations:

1. It assumes that the zeros and positive counts are generated by two separate processes, which may not always be the case in practice.
2. It requires the estimation of additional parameters, which can lead to increased complexity and computational cost.
3. It may not be appropriate for underdispersed count data, where the variance is smaller than the mean.

In such cases, alternative models such as the zero-inflated Poisson distribution or the zero-truncated Negative Binomial distribution may be more appropriate.
