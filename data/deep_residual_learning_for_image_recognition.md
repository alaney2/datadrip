# Deep Residual Learning For Image Recognition

Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, or ResNet, is a deep learning architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks. It was developed by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun from Microsoft Research in 2015.

ResNet addresses the problem of vanishing gradients in very deep neural networks. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradient signal becomes too small to be propagated effectively through each layer of the network during backpropagation. This can result in the network being unable to learn from certain layers and can hinder its overall performance.

ResNet introduces a novel architecture that enables the network to learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning the desired underlying mapping. This is done by adding shortcut connections that bypass one or more layers, allowing the gradient to flow directly through to earlier layers.

The ResNet architecture consists of several residual blocks, each containing multiple convolutional layers with shortcut connections. The output of each block is passed through a rectified linear activation function and then fed into the next block. The number of filters in each convolutional layer is gradually increased to allow the network to learn increasingly complex features.

The ResNet architecture has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of image recognition tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification. It has also been adapted for use in other domains, including natural language processing and speech recognition.

To implement ResNet, one should have a solid understanding of convolutional neural networks, backpropagation, and gradient descent. It is also recommended to review the original ResNet paper as well as other related papers such as VGG and Inception. Additionally, knowledge of batch normalization can be helpful in optimizing the performance of the ResNet architecture.
