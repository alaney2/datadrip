# Structured Prediction

Structured prediction is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning to predict structured objects, such as sequences, trees, or graphs, rather than simple scalar or vector values. It is a generalization of supervised learning, where the goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output structures, given a set of training examples with input-output pairs. Structured prediction has been successfully applied to a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics.

## Problem Formulation

In structured prediction, the goal is to learn a function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the input space and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the output space of structured objects. Given a set of training examples $\{(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{y}_i \in \mathcal{Y}$, the objective is to minimize the empirical risk:


$$

\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L(\mathbf{y}_i, f(\mathbf{x}_i)),

$$


where $L: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the true output $\mathbf{y}_i$ and the predicted output $f(\mathbf{x}_i)$, and $\mathcal{F}$ is a class of functions that can be used to model the mapping from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{Y}$.

## Loss Functions

In structured prediction, the choice of the loss function is crucial, as it determines the quality of the learned function. Commonly used loss functions in structured prediction include:

1. Hamming loss: The Hamming loss is the sum of the element-wise differences between the true output and the predicted output. It is widely used in sequence prediction tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition.


$$

L(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{1}(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i),

$$


where $n$ is the length of the sequence, and $\mathbb{1}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function.

2. Edit distance: The edit distance, also known as the Levenshtein distance, is the minimum number of edit operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one sequence into another. It is often used in string matching tasks, such as spelling correction or DNA sequence alignment.

3. Tree edit distance: The tree edit distance is a generalization of the edit distance for tree-structured data. It is defined as the minimum number of edit operations (node insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one tree into another. It is commonly used in tasks involving tree-structured data, such as parsing or semantic role labeling.

## Optimization Algorithms

Optimization algorithms for structured prediction can be broadly classified into two categories: global optimization and local optimization.

1. Global optimization: Global optimization algorithms aim to find the optimal solution over the entire output space $\mathcal{Y}$. Examples of global optimization algorithms include dynamic programming, integer linear programming, and branch-and-bound search. These algorithms are typically computationally expensive but can guarantee the optimality of the solution.

2. Local optimization: Local optimization algorithms search for a locally optimal solution in the neighborhood of the current solution. Examples of local optimization algorithms include gradient-based methods, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, and coordinate descent methods. These algorithms are usually faster than global optimization algorithms but may not find the globally optimal solution.

## Models for Structured Prediction

There are several popular models for structured prediction, including:

1. Conditional random fields (CRFs): CRFs are a class of probabilistic graphical models that can be used to model the conditional distribution of the output structure given the input features. They have been widely used in sequence labeling tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.

2. Maximum margin Markov networks (M3Ns): M3Ns are a class of discriminative models that extend support vector machines (SVMs) to structured prediction problems. They learn a linear function that maximizes the margin between the true output and the other possible outputs in the output space.

3. Structured support vector machines (SSVMs): SSVMs are an extension of SVMs for structured prediction problems. They learn a linear function that maximizes the margin between the true output and the other possible outputs in the output space, subject to certain constraints on the output structure.

4. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): RNNs are a class of deep learning models that can be used to model sequential data. They have been successfully applied to various structured prediction tasks, such as sequence-to-sequence learning, machine translation, and speech recognition.

5. Graph neural networks (GNNs): GNNs are a class of deep learning models that can be used to model graph-structured data. They have been applied to various structured prediction tasks, such as graph classification, link prediction, and node classification.
