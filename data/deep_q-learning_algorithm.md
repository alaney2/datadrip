# Deep Q-Learning Algorithm

The **Deep Q-Learning Algorithm** is a combination of **Q-Learning** and **Deep Neural Networks**. It is a **Reinforcement Learning** algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which is the expected reward for taking a particular action in a given state. 

## Q-Learning Algorithm

Q-Learning is a model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithm that learns to make optimal decisions by iteratively updating the Q-values of state-action pairs. The Q-value of a state-action pair is the expected reward for taking that action in that state and following the optimal policy thereafter. The optimal policy is the policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time. 

The Q-Learning algorithm updates the Q-value of a state-action pair using the **Bellman Equation**:

$$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\right)$$

where $s$ is the current state, $a$ is the action taken in that state, $s'$ is the next state, $r$ is the reward received for taking that action, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor.

## Deep Q-Learning Algorithm

The Deep Q-Learning Algorithm uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function instead of a lookup table. The neural network takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for all possible actions. The algorithm uses an **Experience Replay** buffer to store the experiences of the agent, which are tuples of $(s,a,r,s')$. The agent samples a batch of experiences from the buffer and uses them to update the neural network using the **Mean Squared Error** loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[\left(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^-}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a)\right)^2\right]$$

where $\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network, $\mathcal{D}$ is the Experience Replay buffer, and $\theta^-$ are the target network parameters, which are updated every $C$ steps to be the same as the current network parameters.

The Deep Q-Learning Algorithm is known to be unstable and can overestimate the Q-values, especially in the early stages of learning. To address this, several improvements have been proposed, such as **Double Q-Learning**, **Dueling Q-Networks**, and **Prioritized Experience Replay**.
