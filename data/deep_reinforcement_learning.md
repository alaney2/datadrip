# Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of machine learning that deals with training artificial agents to learn optimal decision-making policies in complex environments. It combines the principles of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with deep neural networks to learn representations of the state-action value function or policy function.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning that deals with learning from feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. It involves an agent, a set of actions, an environment, and a reward signal. The agent learns to choose actions that maximize the cumulative reward over time.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes that perform computations on input data to produce output predictions.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of neural network that is specifically designed to process images and other spatial data. They consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that is designed to process sequential data. They use a feedback loop to incorporate past information into the current prediction and are commonly used in natural language processing and time-series analysis.

## Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient Methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a parameterized policy function that directly maps states to actions. They optimize the policy using gradient ascent on the expected cumulative reward.

## Q-learning

Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal state-action value function using a table or function approximation. It iteratively updates the Q-values based on the Bellman equation.

## Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic Methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the benefits of both policy gradient methods and value-based methods. They learn a parameterized policy function and a state-value function simultaneously.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search

Monte Carlo Tree Search is a heuristic search algorithm that is commonly used in game playing and decision making. It simulates a large number of possible outcomes and uses the results to guide the search towards the most promising actions.

## Value Iteration

Value Iteration is a dynamic programming algorithm that is used to compute the optimal state-value function of a Markov Decision Process. It iteratively updates the value function based on the Bellman equation until convergence.

## Markov Decision Processes

Markov Decision Processes are a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems in which outcomes are partially random and partially under the control of a decision maker. They are commonly used in reinforcement learning.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique that is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. It is commonly used in reinforcement learning to compute the optimal value function.

## Bellman Equations

Bellman Equations are functional equations that express the optimal value function in terms of the immediate reward and the expected future reward. They are commonly used in reinforcement learning to compute the optimal value function.
