# Ranger

Ranger is an optimization algorithm designed for deep learning models. It was introduced in the 2019 paper, "Ranger: A Fast Implementation of Lookahead Optimizer for Deep Learning" by Less Wright and Leslie Smith.

## Overview

Ranger is a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines several techniques to achieve faster convergence and better performance in deep learning models. It is based on the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. However, Ranger adds several improvements to SGD to make it faster and more stable.

## Features

Ranger has several features that make it stand out from other optimization algorithms. Some of these features include:

- **Lookahead optimization**: Ranger uses a technique called lookahead optimization, which is a form of second-order optimization. This technique involves looking ahead at multiple steps in the optimization process and making adjustments to the gradient descent algorithm to achieve faster convergence.

- **Momentum optimization**: Ranger uses momentum optimization to smooth out the optimization process and prevent oscillations. This technique involves keeping track of the previous gradients and using them to adjust the current gradient in a way that reduces oscillations.

- **Adaptive learning rate methods**: Ranger uses adaptive learning rate methods to adjust the learning rate during training. This technique involves adjusting the learning rate based on the gradient of the loss function, so that the learning rate is larger when the gradient is smaller and smaller when the gradient is larger.

## Performance

Ranger has been shown to outperform other optimization algorithms on a variety of deep learning tasks. In particular, it has been shown to achieve faster convergence and better performance on image classification tasks. Ranger has also been shown to be more stable than other optimization algorithms, which can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.

## Implementation

Ranger is implemented in PyTorch and is available as part of the PyTorch library. It can be used with any deep learning model that uses SGD as the optimization algorithm. To use Ranger, simply import the `Ranger` optimizer from the PyTorch library and use it in place of the regular SGD optimizer.

```python
import torch.optim as optim
from ranger import Ranger

model = ...
optimizer = Ranger(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
```
