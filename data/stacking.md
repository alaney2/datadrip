# Stacking

Stacking, also known as stacked generalization, is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base level models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is fitted on the outputs, or the so-called "meta-features", of the base level models to make a final prediction.

## Overview

Stacking is a way to ensemble multiple classifications or regression model. There are two levels in this model. The first level is the base level, where we train and predict with several base models. Then, the predictions of base models are used as input features for the second level, the meta-model, to predict the final result.

The idea behind stacking is to use a pool of base models, which can be different or of the same type, to generate predictions. These predictions are then used as input features for a higher level model, the meta-model, to make the final prediction. The meta-model is trained to optimally combine the model predictions to form a new set of predictions.

## Process

The general procedure of stacking involves the following steps:

1. **Split the total training set into two disjoint sets**. This can be done with any method, such as train-test split or any cross-validation method.

2. **Train several base models on the first part of the training set**. This can be any typical machine learning models like decision trees, support vector machines, etc.

3. **Test these base models on the second part of the training set**. The base models are used to make predictions on the second part of the training set. This ensures that the predictions are "out-of-sample".

4. **Use the predictions from step 3 as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs to train a higher level learner, or meta-model**. The meta-model is trained to make a final prediction which is a combination of the base models' predictions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Stacking, like any other machine learning technique, has its advantages and disadvantages. 

**Advantages**:

- Stacking often results in better predictive performance compared to any single base model. It reduces both the bias and variance of the model.

- It can be used to combine models of different types, including regression, decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks.

**Disadvantages**:

- Stacking can lead to an increase in complexity when it combines a lot of models.

- It may suffer from overfitting, especially when the number of base models is large.

- It can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train, especially with large datasets or complex base models.

Despite these potential drawbacks, stacking is a powerful tool and is widely used in machine learning and data science competitions due to its ability to improve prediction accuracy.
