# Decision Trees

Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them a popular choice for data scientists.

## How Decision Trees Work

A Decision Tree is a tree-like model where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the value of a single attribute. The attribute that provides the most information gain is chosen as the splitting criterion.

Information gain is a measure of the reduction in entropy achieved by partitioning the data based on a given attribute. Entropy is a measure of the impurity of a set of examples. A set with all examples belonging to the same class has an entropy of 0, while a set with an equal number of examples from each class has an entropy of 1.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Decision Trees

One advantage of Decision Trees is that they are easy to understand and interpret. They can also handle both categorical and continuous input and output variables. Decision Trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and they can handle missing values and noisy data.

However, Decision Trees can be prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Decision Trees can also be sensitive to small changes in the data, which can result in different trees being generated.
