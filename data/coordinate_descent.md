# Coordinate Descent

Coordinate descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the optimal values of the parameters of a model. The algorithm iteratively updates the values of each parameter by minimizing the objective function with respect to one parameter at a time while holding the values of the other parameters fixed.

## Algorithm

The coordinate descent algorithm can be described as follows:

1. Initialize the parameter vector with some initial values.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    1. For each parameter in the parameter vector, update the parameter by minimizing the objective function with respect to that parameter while holding the other parameters fixed. This can be done analytically or using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.
    2. Evaluate the objective function using the updated parameter vector.

The algorithm converges when the change in the objective function is below a certain threshold.

## Advantages and Limitations

Coordinate descent has several advantages over other optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. First, it can be faster in high-dimensional problems because it updates each parameter separately. Second, it can handle non-differentiable objective functions and constraints.

However, coordinate descent can sometimes converge slowly and can get stuck in local minima. It also requires the objective function to be separable with respect to the parameters.

## Applications

Coordinate descent is commonly used in machine learning for solving Lasso regression and Elastic Net problems. It is also used in Ridge regression with the L2-norm penalty.

## Conclusion

Coordinate descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to solve problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces. It updates each parameter separately while holding the other parameters fixed, and it can handle non-differentiable objective functions and constraints. However, it can sometimes converge slowly and get stuck in local minima.
