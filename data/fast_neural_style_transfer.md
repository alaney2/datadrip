# Fast Neural Style Transfer

Fast Neural Style Transfer is a technique used to transfer the style of one image onto another image. It is a faster version of the original Neural Style Transfer algorithm, which was introduced by Gatys et al. in 2015. The original algorithm was computationally expensive and could take several minutes to generate a single stylized image. Fast Neural Style Transfer, on the other hand, can generate stylized images in real-time.

## How it Works

Fast Neural Style Transfer uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to transfer the style of one image onto another. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of images and is able to extract high-level features from an image. These features are used to represent the content and style of an image.

To generate a stylized image, Fast Neural Style Transfer takes two input images: a content image and a style image. The content image is the image that the user wants to stylize, while the style image is the image whose style the user wants to transfer. The CNN is then used to extract the content and style features from both images.

The content features from the content image are then combined with the style features from the style image to generate a new set of features. These new features are then passed through the CNN to generate the stylized image.

## Advantages

Fast Neural Style Transfer has several advantages over the original Neural Style Transfer algorithm. Firstly, it is much faster and can generate stylized images in real-time. This makes it more practical for use in applications such as video processing. Secondly, it requires less memory and can be run on less powerful hardware. This makes it more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Applications

Fast Neural Style Transfer has a wide range of applications. It can be used for artistic purposes, such as generating stylized images or videos. It can also be used for practical purposes, such as image and video editing. For example, it can be used to remove the style of an image or video, or to transfer the style of one image onto another.
