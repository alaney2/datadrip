# Bayesian Neural Networks for Regression

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that incorporate Bayesian inference to estimate the uncertainty in the model's predictions. In the context of regression, BNNs provide a probabilistic approach to modeling the relationship between input features and continuous output variables. This wiki page will discuss the motivation behind BNNs, their formulation, and the methods used for training and inference.

## Motivation

Traditional neural networks, also known as frequentist neural networks, provide point estimates for the model parameters (i.e., weights and biases) and do not account for uncertainty in these estimates. This can lead to overconfident predictions and poor generalization to new data. BNNs address this issue by treating the model parameters as random variables and estimating their probability distributions, which allows for a more robust representation of uncertainty in the model's predictions.

## Formulation

A BNN is defined similarly to a standard neural network, with the primary difference being that the weights and biases are treated as random variables with prior probability distributions. Given a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ of input-output pairs, the goal is to learn the posterior distribution of the model parameters $\mathbf{w}$, given by:


$$

p(\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{D}) = \frac{p(\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w})}{p(\mathcal{D})}

$$


Here, $p(\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{w})$ is the likelihood of the data given the model parameters, $p(\mathbf{w})$ is the prior distribution of the parameters, and $p(\mathcal{D})$ is the marginal likelihood of the data, which acts as a normalization constant.

The likelihood function for a regression problem is typically assumed to be Gaussian, with the mean given by the output of the neural network and a fixed or learnable noise variance:


$$

p(\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{w}) = \prod_{i=1}^N \mathcal{N}(y_i|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i; \mathbf{w}), \sigma^2)

$$


where $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i; \mathbf{w})$ is the output of the neural network for input $\mathbf{x}_i$ and parameters $\mathbf{w}$, and $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance.

The prior distribution for the parameters is often chosen to be Gaussian as well, with zero mean and a fixed or learnable covariance matrix:


$$

p(\mathbf{w}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{\Sigma})

$$


## Training and Inference

Exact inference in BNNs is generally intractable due to the high-dimensional and non-linear nature of the model. Therefore, approximate inference techniques are employed to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters. Two popular approaches for approximate inference in BNNs are Variational Inference (VI) and Monte Carlo methods.

### Variational Inference

VI is an optimization-based approach that approximates the true posterior distribution with a simpler, tractable distribution, such as a Gaussian. The goal is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate distribution and the true posterior:


$$

q^*(\mathbf{w}) = \arg\min_{q(\mathbf{w})} \mathrm{KL}(q(\mathbf{w})||p(\mathbf{w}|\mathcal{D}))

$$


The optimization is performed using gradient-based methods, such as stochastic gradient descent or its variants. Once the optimal approximate distribution is obtained, it can be used to make predictions by averaging over the model parameters:


$$

p(y^*|\mathbf{x}^*, \mathcal{D}) = \int p(y^*|\mathbf{x}^*, \mathbf{w})q^*(\mathbf{w}) d\mathbf{w}

$$


### Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are sampling-based approaches that generate samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. These samples can then be used to make predictions by averaging over the sampled parameters:


$$

p(y^*|\mathbf{x}^*, \mathcal{D}) \approx \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M p(y^*|\mathbf{x}^*, \mathbf{w}^{(m)})

$$


where $\mathbf{w}^{(m)}$ are the sampled parameters and $M$ is the number of samples.

## Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation

Dropout, a popular regularization technique for neural networks, can be interpreted as an approximate Bayesian inference method for BNNs. By applying dropout during both training and inference, the model effectively samples from an approximate posterior distribution of the parameters. This provides a computationally efficient way to estimate uncertainty in the model's predictions.

## Gaussian Processes

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are another probabilistic approach to regression that can provide uncertainty estimates in the predictions. GPs can be seen as a Bayesian non-parametric counterpart to BNNs, where the number of parameters is infinite. While GPs have some advantages, such as exact inference and a more interpretable covariance function, they can be computationally expensive for large datasets and may not scale well to high-dimensional input spaces.

## Conclusion

Bayesian Neural Networks for regression offer a probabilistic approach to modeling the relationship between input features and continuous output variables, providing a more robust representation of uncertainty in the model's predictions. Approximate inference techniques, such as Variational Inference and Monte Carlo methods, are used to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. BNNs can be an attractive alternative to traditional neural networks and other probabilistic regression methods, such as Gaussian Processes, depending on the specific problem and dataset at hand.
