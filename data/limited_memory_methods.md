# Limited Memory Methods

Limited memory methods are optimization algorithms used in machine learning that approximate the Hessian matrix without actually computing it. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or complex models since they require less memory than traditional methods.

In limited memory methods, the inverse of the Hessian matrix is approximated using a subset of the available data. This allows for the optimization to be performed without needing to store the entire dataset in memory. The two most commonly used limited memory methods are the L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) method and the OWL-QN (Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton) method.

## L-BFGS Method

The L-BFGS method is a limited memory version of the BFGS method, which is a popular optimization algorithm in machine learning. The L-BFGS method stores a limited number of previous gradient and parameter values to approximate the Hessian matrix. This approximation is then used to update the parameter values during optimization.

The L-BFGS method is particularly useful for problems with a large number of parameters. It is also well-suited for problems with noisy gradients, which can occur when dealing with large datasets.

## OWL-QN Method

The OWL-QN method is a limited memory version of the Quasi-Newton method, which is another popular optimization algorithm in machine learning. The OWL-QN method is particularly useful for problems with sparse parameters, where many of the parameter values are zero.

The OWL-QN method uses a subset of the available data to approximate the Hessian matrix. This approximation is then used to update the parameter values during optimization. The OWL-QN method also uses an orthant-wise approach to regularization, which can improve convergence and reduce overfitting.

## Conclusion

Limited memory methods are powerful optimization algorithms that are particularly useful in machine learning applications. These methods require less memory than traditional optimization algorithms, making them well-suited for large datasets or complex models. The L-BFGS and OWL-QN methods are two popular examples of limited memory methods that are commonly used in machine learning.
