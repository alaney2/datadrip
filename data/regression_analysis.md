# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of regression analysis is to find the best-fitting line or curve to describe the relationship between the variables. Regression analysis is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, psychology, and engineering.

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis with only one independent variable. The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is modeled by a straight line. The equation for simple linear regression is:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon $$

where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is a type of regression analysis with two or more independent variables. The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is modeled by a plane or hyperplane. The equation for multiple linear regression is:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon $$

where Y is the dependent variable, $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_p$ are the independent variables, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, ..., $\beta_p$ are the slopes, and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of logistic regression is to find the best-fitting curve to describe the relationship between the variables. Logistic regression is widely used in various fields such as medicine, biology, and social sciences.

The equation for logistic regression is:

$$ \ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p $$

where p is the probability of the dependent variable being in the positive class, $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_p$ are the independent variables, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, ..., $\beta_p$ are the slopes.
