# Linear Transformations

A **linear transformation** is a function that maps vectors from one vector space to another in a way that preserves linear relationships. In other words, it takes vectors as inputs and outputs a transformed vector that still maintains the same basic structure.

Formally, a linear transformation $T$ from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$ is a function that satisfies the following properties:

1. For any vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ in $V$, $T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})$
2. For any vector $\mathbf{u}$ in $V$ and scalar $c$, $T(c\mathbf{u}) = cT(\mathbf{u})$

These properties ensure that the linear transformation preserves the basic structure of the vector space, such as addition and scalar multiplication.

One way to represent a linear transformation is through a matrix. Given a linear transformation $T$ from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$, we can represent $T$ by a matrix $A$ such that $T(\mathbf{v}) = A\mathbf{v}$ for any vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $V$. This representation allows us to apply the transformation to vectors using matrix multiplication.

Linear transformations have many applications in AI, ML, and DL. For example, in image processing, a linear transformation can be used to stretch or compress an image in a certain direction. In deep learning, linear transformations are often used as the first step in a neural network layer, where the input data is transformed into a new feature space.

## Prerequisites

To fully understand linear transformations, it is recommended to have a solid understanding of the following topics:

- Matrix Multiplication: Linear transformations can be represented by matrices, so understanding matrix multiplication is important for working with linear transformations.
- Vector Spaces: Linear transformations map vectors from one vector space to another, so understanding the concept of a vector space is crucial.
- Linear Algebra: Linear transformations are a fundamental concept in linear algebra, so a basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary.
