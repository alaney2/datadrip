# Conjugate Gradient For Eigenvalue Problems

Conjugate gradient (CG) is an iterative algorithm that can solve large systems of linear equations efficiently. It is often used in the context of eigenvalue problems, where one is interested in finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix. The conjugate gradient method can be used to find a subset of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, which are typically the ones with the largest magnitude.

## How it works

The conjugate gradient method starts with an initial guess for the solution to a linear system of equations. The algorithm then iteratively improves this solution by finding a search direction that is conjugate to the previous search direction. The search direction is found by minimizing the residual error of the linear system of equations along that direction.

In the context of eigenvalue problems, the conjugate gradient method can be used to find the eigenvectors of a matrix that correspond to the largest eigenvalues. The algorithm starts with a random initial guess for the eigenvector, and then iteratively improves it by finding the search direction that maximizes the Rayleigh quotient:

$$
\alpha_k = \frac{\mathbf{v}_k^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_k}{\mathbf{v}_k^T \mathbf{v}_k}
$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is the matrix whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues we are interested in, and $\mathbf{v}_k$ is the current estimate of the eigenvector. The search direction is then given by the residual error of the linear system of equations:

$$
\mathbf{r}_k = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v}_k - \alpha_k \mathbf{v}_k
$$

The conjugate gradient method then searches for the next conjugate direction:

$$
\mathbf{p}_k = \mathbf{r}_k + \beta_k \mathbf{p}_{k-1}
$$

where $\beta_k$ is chosen to ensure that $\mathbf{p}_k$ is conjugate to all previous search directions. The algorithm then repeats the process of finding the maximum Rayleigh quotient along the search direction, and updating the search direction until convergence.

## Applications

The conjugate gradient method is widely used in scientific computing and machine learning. In particular, it is often used in the context of solving large systems of linear equations that arise in numerical simulations, such as finite element methods. In machine learning, the conjugate gradient method can be used for solving optimization problems, such as support vector machines and logistic regression.

In the context of eigenvalue problems, the conjugate gradient method is often used for finding the dominant eigenvectors and eigenvalues of large matrices. This is useful in many applications, such as principal component analysis, spectral clustering, and graph Laplacian eigenmaps.
