# Numerical Methods For Derivatives

Numerical Methods for Derivatives are techniques used to numerically compute derivatives of a function at a given point or interval. Derivatives are an important mathematical tool in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. They help in finding the rate of change of a function, the slope of a tangent line, the curvature of a curve, and the optimization of a function. 

There are different numerical methods for computing derivatives, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the commonly used numerical methods for derivatives include:

## Finite Difference Method

The Finite Difference Method is a numerical method for computing derivatives by approximating the derivative of a function at a point using a difference quotient. It is based on the fact that the derivative of a function at a point is equal to the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. The basic idea behind the finite difference method is to compute the slope of the tangent line to the function using two nearby points on the function. 

## Newton-Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson Method is an iterative numerical method for finding roots of a function. It is based on Newton's method and involves using the derivative of a function to iteratively update an initial guess of the root until a desired level of accuracy is achieved. The Newton-Raphson method can also be used to approximate derivatives of a function by computing the derivative of the function at each iteration. 

## Automatic Differentiation

Automatic Differentiation is a computational technique for computing derivatives of functions using a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations. It is based on the chain rule of differentiation and involves computing the derivative of each elementary operation and combining them to obtain the derivative of the entire function. Automatic Differentiation is commonly used in machine learning and optimization algorithms to efficiently compute gradients of functions with a large number of variables.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

Stochastic Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning for finding the optimal parameters of a model. It involves iteratively updating the parameters of the model using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. The gradient is computed using a subset of the training data at each iteration, making the algorithm computationally efficient for large datasets. Stochastic Gradient Descent can also be used to compute the derivatives of a function.

In conclusion, Numerical Methods for Derivatives are important tools for computing derivatives of functions in various fields. The choice of the numerical method to use depends on the specific problem and the desired level of accuracy. Some of the commonly used numerical methods for derivatives include the finite difference method, Newton-Raphson method, Automatic Differentiation, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
