# Average Precision Score

The average precision score is a performance metric used in binary classification problems to evaluate the effectiveness of a classifier. It is a summary of the precision-recall curve, which plots the precision (positive predictive value) against the recall (sensitivity) for different classification thresholds. The average precision score is the area under the precision-recall curve, which represents the classifier's ability to correctly identify positive instances while minimizing false positives.

## Definition

Given a binary classification problem with a set of true labels $y_{true}$ and predicted probabilities $y_{pred}$, the average precision score can be computed as follows:

1. Compute the precision-recall curve by varying the classification threshold and calculating the precision and recall at each threshold.
2. Calculate the area under the precision-recall curve.

Mathematically, the average precision score can be expressed as:


$$

AP = \sum_{n} (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

$$


where $AP$ is the average precision score, $R_n$ is the recall at the $n$-th threshold, $R_{n-1}$ is the recall at the $(n-1)$-th threshold, and $P_n$ is the precision at the $n$-th threshold.

## Interpretation

The average precision score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better classifier performance. A perfect classifier would have an average precision score of 1, meaning that it can correctly identify all positive instances without any false positives. Conversely, a random classifier would have an average precision score close to the ratio of positive instances in the dataset, as it would be expected to perform no better than random chance.

The average precision score is particularly useful in situations where the class distribution is imbalanced, as it takes into account both precision and recall. In such cases, other metrics like accuracy may not be informative, as a classifier that predicts the majority class for all instances would still achieve high accuracy.

## Comparison to Other Metrics

The average precision score is related to other classification performance metrics, such as the F1 score and the ROC AUC score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is used to measure the trade-off between precision and recall. The ROC AUC score is the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different classification thresholds.

While all these metrics provide insights into classifier performance, they have different emphases and may be more suitable for different situations. The average precision score is particularly useful when the focus is on identifying positive instances with high precision and recall, while the ROC AUC score is more appropriate when the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate is of interest.

## Example

Consider a binary classification problem with the following true labels and predicted probabilities:

```
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.55, 0.54, 0.53, 0.52, 0.51, 0.505]
```

To compute the average precision score, we first calculate the precision-recall curve by varying the classification threshold:

```
Thresholds: [0.505, 0.51, 0.52, 0.53, 0.54, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
Precision:  [0.6, 0.571, 0.667, 0.6, 0.75, 0.667, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
Recall:     [1.0, 0.833, 0.833, 0.667, 0.667, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.333, 0.0]
```

Next, we calculate the area under the precision-recall curve:

```
AP = (1.0 - 0.833) * 0.571 + (0.833 - 0.667) * 0.667 + (0.667 - 0.5) * 0.75 + (0.5 - 0.333) * 1.0
   = 0.137 + 0.111 + 0.125 + 0.167
   = 0.54
```

The average precision score for this classifier is 0.54, indicating moderate performance in identifying positive instances while minimizing false positives.
