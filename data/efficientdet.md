# EfficientDet

EfficientDet is a state-of-the-art object detection model introduced by Mingxing Tan, Ruoming Pang, and Quoc V. Le in their paper titled "EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection" in 2019. It is designed to be highly efficient in terms of both accuracy and computational resources. EfficientDet achieves this by employing a novel compound scaling method that jointly scales the resolution, depth, and width of the network while maintaining a balance between the three. This results in a family of models, EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D7, with varying levels of accuracy and computational requirements.

## Architecture

EfficientDet's architecture consists of three main components: a backbone network, a feature pyramid network (FPN), and a class and box prediction network. The backbone network is responsible for extracting features from the input image, the FPN generates a multi-scale feature pyramid, and the class and box prediction network produces the final object detection results.

### Backbone Network

EfficientDet uses EfficientNet as its backbone network. EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are designed to be highly efficient in terms of both accuracy and computational resources. It employs a compound scaling method that jointly scales the resolution, depth, and width of the network while maintaining a balance between the three. This results in a family of models, EfficientNet-B0 to EfficientNet-B7, with varying levels of accuracy and computational requirements.

### Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)

EfficientDet employs a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) to generate a multi-scale feature pyramid. The BiFPN is an improved version of the original FPN, which only used top-down connections to combine features from different scales. The BiFPN adds bottom-up connections, allowing information to flow in both directions. This results in a more effective fusion of features from different scales, leading to improved object detection performance.

### Class and Box Prediction Network

The class and box prediction network in EfficientDet is responsible for producing the final object detection results. It consists of two parallel subnetworks: one for class prediction and one for box prediction. Both subnetworks use convolutional layers followed by sigmoid activation functions to produce their respective outputs. The class prediction network outputs a probability distribution over the possible object classes for each anchor box, while the box prediction network outputs the coordinates of the bounding boxes for each anchor box.

## Anchor Boxes

EfficientDet uses anchor boxes to generate candidate bounding boxes for objects in the input image. Anchor boxes are predefined bounding boxes with different scales and aspect ratios that are placed at regular intervals across the image. The model predicts the probability of each anchor box containing an object, as well as the adjustments needed to refine the anchor box to better fit the object.

## Loss Functions

EfficientDet uses a combination of two loss functions to train the model: classification loss and localization loss. The classification loss is a focal loss, which is designed to address the class imbalance problem in object detection tasks. The localization loss is a smooth L1 loss, which measures the difference between the predicted bounding box coordinates and the ground truth coordinates.

## Compound Scaling

One of the key innovations in EfficientDet is the use of compound scaling to create a family of models with varying levels of accuracy and computational requirements. Compound scaling jointly scales the resolution, depth, and width of the network while maintaining a balance between the three. This is achieved by using a compound coefficient $\phi$ to scale the input image resolution, the number of layers in the backbone network, and the number of channels in the feature pyramid network. The compound coefficient is determined by a grid search over a range of values, and the resulting models are denoted as EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D7.

## Performance

EfficientDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO object detection benchmark, outperforming other popular object detection models such as YOLOv3, RetinaNet, and SSD. The model is also highly efficient in terms of computational resources, with EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D7 offering a range of trade-offs between accuracy and computational requirements. This makes EfficientDet suitable for a wide range of applications, from resource-constrained devices to high-performance servers.
