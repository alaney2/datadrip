# Thompson Sampling Algorithm

Thompson Sampling Algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm used for decision-making problems in which actions are taken sequentially over time. It is a type of Bayesian algorithm that uses prior knowledge to make decisions. The algorithm is used in various fields, including online advertising, healthcare, and finance.

## Bayesian Inference

Bayesian Inference is a statistical method that uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or data becomes available. It is used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to update the prior distribution of the parameters of the model.

## Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem is a classic problem in probability theory and decision-making. It involves a gambler who must decide which slot machine to play, each with a different payout probability. The problem is used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to model the decision-making process.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It is used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to model the sequential decision-making process.

## Contextual Bandits

Contextual Bandits is a variant of the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem in which the payout probabilities of the slot machines depend on the context or state of the environment. It is used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to model more complex decision-making problems.

## Online Learning

Online Learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is updated continuously as new data becomes available. It is used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to model the sequential decision-making process.

Thompson Sampling Algorithm is a powerful tool for decision-making problems in which actions are taken sequentially over time. It uses Bayesian Inference to update the prior distribution of the parameters of the model and is used in various fields, including online advertising, healthcare, and finance. The algorithm is based on the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem and can be extended to more complex decision-making problems, such as Contextual Bandits. Reinforcement Learning and Online Learning are also used in Thompson Sampling Algorithm to model the sequential decision-making process.
