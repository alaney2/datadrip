# Continuous Action Spaces In Deep Reinforcement Learning

Continuous action spaces in deep reinforcement learning refer to the scenario where the agent can take actions from a continuous set of possible actions. This is in contrast to discrete action spaces, where the agent can only choose from a finite set of actions. 

In deep reinforcement learning, continuous action spaces are often handled using policy gradient methods. These methods optimize the policy directly, rather than estimating the value function. This is because the policy is a function that maps states to actions, and can be optimized using gradient descent. 

One popular method for handling continuous action spaces is the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm. DPG is an actor-critic method that learns a deterministic policy function. The critic estimates the value function, while the actor learns the policy by taking gradient steps with respect to the estimated value function. 

Another approach is the stochastic policy gradient (SPG) algorithm, which learns a stochastic policy function. The policy is represented as a probability distribution over actions, and the algorithm learns to maximize the expected reward under this distribution. 

In addition to these methods, there are also hybrid approaches that combine elements of both DPG and SPG. For example, the actor-critic with experience replay (ACER) algorithm uses a combination of DPG and SPG to handle continuous action spaces. 

Overall, continuous action spaces in deep reinforcement learning present a unique challenge, but there are several effective methods for handling them. By using policy gradient methods, agents can learn to take actions from a continuous set of possibilities and achieve high performance on a wide range of tasks.
