# Second Order Methods

Second order methods are a class of optimization algorithms used in machine learning and deep learning. These methods use second order derivative information, also known as the Hessian, to guide the search for the minimum or maximum of a function. This is in contrast to first order methods, such as gradient descent, which only use first order derivative information.

## Overview

The key idea behind second order methods is to use the curvature of the function to guide the optimization process. This is done by computing the Hessian matrix, which is a square matrix of second order partial derivatives. The Hessian provides information about the curvature of the function, which can be used to make more informed steps during the optimization process.

In general, second order methods can converge faster than first order methods because they take into account more information about the function. However, they are also more computationally expensive because computing the Hessian and its inverse can be costly, especially for high-dimensional problems.

## Newton's Method

One of the most well-known second order methods is Newton's method. This method uses the Hessian to compute a step direction that is expected to lead to a rapid decrease in the function value. The update rule for Newton's method is given by:


$$

x_{k+1} = x_k - \nabla^2 f(x_k)^{-1} \nabla f(x_k)

$$


where $\nabla^2 f(x_k)$ is the Hessian at $x_k$ and $\nabla f(x_k)$ is the gradient at $x_k$.

## Quasi-Newton Methods

Quasi-Newton methods are a class of second order methods that approximate the Hessian instead of computing it directly. This can significantly reduce the computational cost of the method, making it more suitable for large-scale problems.

One of the most popular quasi-Newton methods is the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. This method uses an iterative procedure to update an approximation of the Hessian, based on the gradients at the current and previous steps.

## Limitations and Challenges

While second order methods can provide faster convergence and more accurate solutions than first order methods, they also come with their own set of challenges. The main challenge is the computational cost of computing and inverting the Hessian, which can be prohibitive for large-scale problems.

Furthermore, second order methods require the function to be twice differentiable, which is not always the case in practice. In such cases, modifications or approximations may be needed, which can add to the complexity of the method.

Despite these challenges, second order methods remain a valuable tool in the toolbox of machine learning and deep learning practitioners, offering a powerful alternative to first order methods for optimization problems.
