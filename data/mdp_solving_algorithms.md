# MDP Solving Algorithms

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are used to model decision-making processes in which the outcome of each action is uncertain. MDPs are widely used in AI, ML, and DL to solve a wide range of problems, including robotics, game theory, and optimization problems. MDPs require solving for the optimal policy to maximize the expected reward over time. 

## Markov Chain

MDPs are based on the concept of Markov chains, which are stochastic processes that depend only on the current state and not on the past. Markov chains are used to model the random transitions in MDPs.

## Bellman Equation

The Bellman equation is a recursive formula used to calculate the value of a state or a state-action pair in an MDP. The Bellman equation is based on the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal policy has the property that, whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

## Value Iteration

Value iteration is a dynamic programming algorithm used to solve MDPs. Value iteration iteratively updates the value function until it converges to the optimal value function. Value iteration is guaranteed to converge to the optimal value function, but it can be computationally expensive.

## Policy Iteration

Policy iteration is a dynamic programming algorithm used to solve MDPs. Policy iteration iteratively updates the policy until it converges to the optimal policy. Policy iteration is computationally less expensive than value iteration, but it does not guarantee convergence to the optimal policy.

## Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods are a family of algorithms used to estimate the value function and the optimal policy in an MDP. Monte Carlo methods are based on sampling the state and action space and using the samples to estimate the value function and the optimal policy.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a family of algorithms used to solve MDPs. Dynamic programming algorithms solve MDPs by breaking them down into subproblems and solving them recursively. Dynamic programming algorithms are computationally expensive, but they guarantee convergence to the optimal value function and the optimal policy.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a family of algorithms used to solve MDPs. Reinforcement learning algorithms learn the optimal value function and the optimal policy by interacting with the environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms can be model-free or model-based.

## Q-Learning

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn the optimal value function and the optimal policy in an MDP. Q-learning updates the Q-value of a state-action pair based on the reward received and the Q-value of the next state-action pair.

## Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal difference learning is a family of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms used to learn the optimal value function and the optimal policy in an MDP. Temporal difference learning algorithms update the value function based on the difference between the estimated value and the actual reward received.

## Further Readings

For a deeper understanding of MDP solving algorithms, the following topics are recommended: actor-critic methods, deep reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, online learning in MDPs, approximate dynamic programming, model-based reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, imitation learning in RL, and off-policy RL.
