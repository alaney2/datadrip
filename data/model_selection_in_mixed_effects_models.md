# Model Selection in Mixed Effects Models

Model selection is an essential step in the process of analyzing mixed effects models. Mixed effects models, including linear mixed effects models (LMMs) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs), are used to analyze data with both fixed and random effects. The goal of model selection is to choose the best model among a set of candidate models, considering the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit.

There are several methods for model selection in mixed effects models, including likelihood ratio tests, information criteria (such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)), and cross-validation techniques. In this article, we will discuss these methods and their application in mixed effects models.

## Likelihood Ratio Test

The likelihood ratio test (LRT) is a classical method for comparing nested models, i.e., models that can be obtained by imposing constraints on the parameters of a more general model. In the context of mixed effects models, nested models often arise when comparing models with different random effects structures.

The LRT is based on the likelihood ratio statistic, which is defined as the ratio of the likelihoods of the two models being compared:


$$

\Lambda = \frac{L(\theta_0 | \mathbf{y})}{L(\theta_1 | \mathbf{y})}

$$


where $L(\theta_0 | \mathbf{y})$ and $L(\theta_1 | \mathbf{y})$ are the likelihoods of the null model (with constraints) and the alternative model (without constraints), respectively. The likelihood ratio statistic follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models. The null hypothesis is rejected if the likelihood ratio statistic is greater than the critical value from the chi-square distribution.

The LRT has some limitations when applied to mixed effects models. First, it can only be used for comparing nested models. Second, it assumes that the models being compared have the same fixed effects structure, which may not always be the case in practice.

## Information Criteria

Information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), are widely used for model selection in mixed effects models. These criteria balance the goodness of fit and model complexity by penalizing the addition of parameters.

The AIC is defined as:


$$

\text{AIC} = -2 \log L(\hat{\theta} | \mathbf{y}) + 2k

$$


where $L(\hat{\theta} | \mathbf{y})$ is the maximum likelihood of the model, $k$ is the number of parameters, and $\hat{\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. The model with the lowest AIC is considered the best among the candidate models.

The BIC is defined as:


$$

\text{BIC} = -2 \log L(\hat{\theta} | \mathbf{y}) + k \log n

$$


where $n$ is the sample size. Like the AIC, the model with the lowest BIC is considered the best among the candidate models.

Both AIC and BIC can be used to compare non-nested models and models with different fixed effects structures. However, they may not always agree on the best model, as the BIC tends to favor simpler models due to its larger penalty for model complexity.

## Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a popular model selection technique that can be applied to mixed effects models. The basic idea of cross-validation is to partition the data into training and validation sets, fit the model to the training set, and evaluate its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated multiple times, and the average performance across all validation sets is used as a measure of model quality.

There are several types of cross-validation, such as k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and leave-one-group-out cross-validation. In the context of mixed effects models, leave-one-group-out cross-validation is particularly relevant, as it accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data by leaving out one group (e.g., one subject or one cluster) at a time.

Cross-validation has some advantages over LRT and information criteria, as it does not rely on asymptotic assumptions and can be used to compare models with different fixed and random effects structures. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets and complex models.

## Conclusion

Model selection in mixed effects models is an important step in the analysis of hierarchical data. Several methods, including likelihood ratio tests, information criteria, and cross-validation, can be used to choose the best model among a set of candidate models. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of the most appropriate method depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.
