# Asynchronous Actor Critic

Asynchronous Actor Critic is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines the advantages of both actor-critic and asynchronous methods. It is a variant of the actor-critic algorithm that uses multiple agents to update the policy and value function in parallel, making it more efficient and scalable than traditional actor-critic methods.

## Overview

Asynchronous Actor Critic is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a combination of actor and critic networks to learn a policy and value function, respectively. The actor network is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state, while the critic network evaluates the value of the current state and the selected action. The goal of the algorithm is to maximize the expected reward over time by updating the policy and value function based on the observed rewards.

The asynchronous aspect of the algorithm comes from the fact that multiple agents are used to update the policy and value function in parallel. This allows for more efficient use of computational resources and faster convergence to an optimal policy. The agents operate independently and asynchronously, meaning that they do not need to wait for each other to finish before updating the shared parameters.

## Algorithm

The Asynchronous Actor Critic algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the actor and critic networks with random weights.
2. Initialize a set of agents, each with a copy of the actor and critic networks.
3. For each agent:
   1. Observe the current state.
   2. Select an action based on the current policy.
   3. Execute the action and observe the reward and next state.
   4. Calculate the temporal difference error and update the critic network.
   5. Update the actor network using the policy gradient method.
4. Synchronize the shared parameters of the actor and critic networks across all agents.

The policy gradient method used to update the actor network is typically the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm, which uses the advantage function to estimate the value of taking an action in a given state compared to the expected value of the current policy. This allows for more efficient updates of the policy by reducing the variance of the gradient estimates.

## Advantages

Asynchronous Actor Critic has several advantages over traditional actor-critic methods:

- Scalability: The use of multiple agents allows for more efficient use of computational resources and faster convergence to an optimal policy.
- Robustness: The asynchronous nature of the algorithm makes it more robust to noisy or delayed updates.
- Exploration: The use of multiple agents can help to explore the state space more thoroughly and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
