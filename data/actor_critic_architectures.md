# Actor Critic Architectures

Actor Critic Architectures are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that combine the benefits of both policy-based and value-based methods. In these architectures, there are two separate neural networks: the actor network and the critic network. The actor network is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state, while the critic network evaluates the value of the state.

## Actor Network

The actor network is a policy-based method that outputs a probability distribution over the possible actions given the current state. This distribution is then sampled to select the action to take. The actor network is trained using policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE or the more advanced methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C).

## Critic Network

The critic network is a value-based method that estimates the value of the current state. This value is used to evaluate the quality of the action taken by the actor network. The critic network is trained using value function approximation methods, such as Q-Learning or SARSA.

## Actor Critic Algorithm

The Actor Critic Algorithm combines the actor and critic networks to learn the optimal policy. The algorithm alternates between updating the actor network and the critic network. The actor network is updated using policy gradient methods to maximize the expected reward, while the critic network is updated using value function approximation methods to minimize the mean squared error between the estimated value and the actual value.

The Actor Critic Algorithm has been shown to be effective in a variety of applications, including game playing, robotics, and finance.
