# Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Optimizer

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) optimizer, also known as Nesterov momentum optimizer, is a gradient-based optimization algorithm used in machine learning. It is an extension of the momentum optimizer that enables faster convergence while minimizing oscillation.

## How it works

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters, but instead of updating the parameters directly, it first calculates the gradient at a future point in the direction of the previous accumulated gradient. This is done by computing a partial update of the parameters using the accumulated gradient, and then computing the gradient of the loss function at that point. The final update of the parameters is then based on the computed gradient at the future point.

Mathematically, the update rule for Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer can be expressed as follows:

$$
v_t = \gamma v_{t-1} + \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta - \gamma v_{t-1}) \\
\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - v_t
$$

where $\theta$ represents the model parameters, $J$ represents the loss function, $t$ represents the iteration step, $\eta$ represents the learning rate, $\gamma$ represents the momentum term, and $v$ represents the accumulated gradient.

## Advantages

Compared to other optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer has the following advantages:

- Faster convergence: By computing the gradient at a future point, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer can avoid oscillations and converge faster than traditional momentum optimizer.
- Improved accuracy: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer can improve the accuracy of the model by reducing the variance of the gradient updates.
- Robustness: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer is less sensitive to the choice of learning rate than other optimization algorithms.

## Disadvantages

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer has the following disadvantages:

- Computationally expensive: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer requires additional computations to compute the gradient at a future point, which can be computationally expensive.
- Requires careful tuning: The momentum term and learning rate need to be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance.

## Conclusion

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer is a powerful optimization algorithm that can improve the convergence and accuracy of machine learning models. However, it requires careful tuning and can be computationally expensive. Other optimization algorithms like ADAGRAD, ADAM, and RMSProp can also be used depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
