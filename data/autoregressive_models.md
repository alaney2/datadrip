# Autoregressive Models

Autoregressive (AR) models are a class of linear models used for modeling time series data. They are based on the assumption that the current value of a time series can be expressed as a linear combination of its past values, plus an error term. The order of an autoregressive model, denoted as $p$, represents the number of past values used in the model. An autoregressive model of order $p$ is denoted as AR($p$).

## Definition

Given a time series $\{y_t\}$, an autoregressive model of order $p$ can be defined as:


$$

y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t

$$


where $c$ is a constant, $\phi_i$ are the autoregressive coefficients, and $\epsilon_t$ is the error term, which is usually assumed to be white noise with zero mean and constant variance $\sigma^2$.

## Estimation

The parameters of an autoregressive model, including the constant $c$ and the autoregressive coefficients $\phi_i$, can be estimated using various methods, such as:

1. **Least Squares**: The least squares method minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values of the time series. This method is equivalent to linear regression, where the dependent variable is the current value of the time series, and the independent variables are its past values.

2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: MLE is a statistical method that estimates the parameters of a model by maximizing the likelihood function. For autoregressive models, the likelihood function is derived from the joint probability density function of the time series, assuming that the error terms are normally distributed.

3. **Bayesian Estimation**: Bayesian estimation incorporates prior knowledge about the parameters of the model in the form of a prior distribution. The posterior distribution of the parameters is then obtained by updating the prior distribution with the observed data using Bayes' theorem. This method can be particularly useful when the sample size is small or the time series exhibits non-stationary behavior.

## Model Selection

Choosing the appropriate order $p$ for an autoregressive model is an important step in the modeling process. A common approach is to use information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balance the goodness-of-fit of the model with the number of parameters. Lower values of AIC or BIC indicate a better model. Another approach is to use cross-validation, where the model is fitted on a subset of the data and its performance is evaluated on the remaining data.

## Extensions and Variations

There are several extensions and variations of autoregressive models, including:

1. **Moving Average (MA) Models**: MA models express the current value of a time series as a linear combination of past error terms. They can be combined with autoregressive models to form Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, which are more flexible and can capture a wider range of time series patterns.

2. **Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) Models**: ARCH models allow for time-varying volatility in the error terms, which can be useful for modeling financial time series with changing risk levels.

3. **Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models**: VAR models extend autoregressive models to multivariate time series by modeling the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.

4. **Bayesian Autoregressive Models**: Bayesian autoregressive models incorporate prior knowledge about the parameters of the model in the form of a prior distribution, which can be particularly useful when the sample size is small or the time series exhibits non-stationary behavior.

## Applications

Autoregressive models are widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, engineering, and environmental science, for tasks such as:

- Forecasting future values of a time series
- Identifying the underlying structure and dependencies in the data
- Detecting anomalies or outliers in the time series
- Evaluating the impact of interventions or policy changes on the time series

In summary, autoregressive models are a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing time series data, with numerous extensions and variations that can be tailored to specific applications and data characteristics.
