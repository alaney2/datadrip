# Few Shot Learning

Few Shot Learning (FSL) refers to the ability of a machine learning algorithm to recognize new objects or classes from just a few examples. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms that require a large amount of labeled data to learn, these algorithms can learn to recognize new objects or classes from only a few examples.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns to map inputs to outputs based on labeled examples. In other words, it learns from labeled data that has already been classified. Supervised Learning is a prerequisite for few shot learning as it forms the basis for the few shot learning algorithms.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns to identify patterns and relationships in unlabeled data. Unsupervised Learning is a prerequisite for few shot learning as it helps in identifying the common features between different classes.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the creation of neural networks with multiple layers to learn and make decisions. Deep Learning is a prerequisite for few shot learning as it has been shown to be very effective in learning from small amounts of data.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep neural network that are primarily used for image recognition. CNNs are a prerequisite for few shot learning as they form the backbone of many few shot learning algorithms.

## Meta Learning

Meta Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns to learn. In other words, it learns to recognize patterns in the way it learns and adapts its learning strategy accordingly. Meta Learning is a further reading for few shot learning as it has been used to improve the performance of few shot learning algorithms.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning is a type of machine learning where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for another task. Transfer Learning is a further reading for few shot learning as it has been used to improve the performance of few shot learning algorithms.

## One Shot Learning

One Shot Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns to recognize new objects or classes from just one example. One Shot Learning is a further reading for few shot learning as it is a more extreme version of few shot learning, where the model has to learn from a single example.
