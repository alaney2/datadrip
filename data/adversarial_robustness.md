# Adversarial Robustness

Adversarial Robustness is the ability of a machine learning model to maintain its performance when it is exposed to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are inputs that are specifically designed to deceive the machine learning model. These inputs are generated by adding small perturbations to the original inputs. Despite the small magnitude of these perturbations, they can cause the machine learning model to misclassify the input with high confidence.

## Adversarial Examples

Adversarial examples are crafted to exploit the vulnerabilities of machine learning models. These inputs are generated by adding small perturbations to the original inputs. The perturbations are carefully designed to maximize the change in the output of the machine learning model. Adversarial examples can be created for various types of machine learning models, including neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.

## Adversarial Training

Adversarial training is a method of improving the robustness of machine learning models to adversarial examples. The method involves training the machine learning model on both original and adversarial examples. By doing so, the machine learning model learns to classify the adversarial examples as well as the original examples. This results in a machine learning model that is more robust to adversarial examples.

## Defensive Distillation

Defensive distillation is a method of improving the robustness of machine learning models to adversarial examples. The method involves training the machine learning model on a distilled version of the data. The distilled version of the data is generated by applying a smoothing function to the original data. By doing so, the machine learning model learns to classify the smoothed data, which is more resistant to adversarial perturbations. Defensive distillation can be used in conjunction with adversarial training to further improve the robustness of machine learning models.

## Conclusion

Adversarial robustness is an important research topic in machine learning. Adversarial examples pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of machine learning models. Adversarial training and defensive distillation are two methods that can be used to improve the robustness of machine learning models to adversarial examples. Further research is needed to develop more advanced techniques for improving the adversarial robustness of machine learning models.
