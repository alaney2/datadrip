# MnasNet

MnasNet is a family of mobile neural network architectures designed for efficient on-device inference. It was introduced by Google researchers in 2018 and stands for Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search Network. MnasNet aims to optimize both the accuracy and efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for mobile and edge devices. The key idea behind MnasNet is to use neural architecture search (NAS) to find the best architecture that meets multiple objectives, such as low latency and high accuracy.

## Neural Architecture Search

Neural architecture search (NAS) is a technique that automates the process of designing neural network architectures. It involves searching through a large space of possible architectures to find the one that performs best on a given task. NAS has been used to discover state-of-the-art architectures for various tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In MnasNet, the researchers used a reinforcement learning-based NAS method to search for the optimal architecture. The search space was defined by a set of mobile-friendly operations, such as depthwise separable convolutions and inverted residuals. The search algorithm was guided by a reward function that considered both the accuracy and latency of the candidate architectures. This multi-objective optimization allowed MnasNet to find architectures that strike a balance between high accuracy and low computational cost.

## MnasNet Architecture

The MnasNet architecture is based on a hierarchical structure, where each layer consists of a set of mobile-friendly operations. The basic building block of MnasNet is the inverted residual with linear bottleneck, which was first introduced in MobileNetV2. This operation consists of a pointwise convolution, followed by a depthwise convolution, and another pointwise convolution. The input and output of the block are connected through a residual connection if their dimensions match.

MnasNet also employs squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, which are used to adaptively recalibrate the feature maps. SE blocks consist of two fully connected layers, followed by a sigmoid activation function. The output of the SE block is used to scale the feature maps, allowing the network to emphasize or suppress certain channels based on their importance.

The overall architecture of MnasNet is divided into several stages, each with a different number of inverted residual blocks and varying output channel sizes. The first stage consists of a standard convolutional layer, followed by a series of inverted residual blocks. The subsequent stages are connected by stride-2 convolutions, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. The final stage is followed by a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer for classification.

## Performance and Applications

MnasNet has demonstrated competitive performance on various benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet and COCO. The architecture achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for mobile and edge devices with limited computational resources. MnasNet has been used in various applications, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Several variants of MnasNet have been proposed, with different trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. For example, MnasNet-A1 is a more accurate but slightly slower version, while MnasNet-B1 is a faster but less accurate version. These variants can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the target application and device.

## Conclusion

MnasNet is a family of mobile neural network architectures that optimize both accuracy and efficiency for on-device inference. By using neural architecture search with a multi-objective reward function, MnasNet is able to find architectures that strike a balance between high accuracy and low computational cost. The resulting architectures are well-suited for mobile and edge devices, enabling a wide range of applications in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
