# Multilevel Poisson Regression

Multilevel Poisson regression is a statistical modeling technique used to analyze count data that have a hierarchical or clustered structure. It is an extension of the Poisson regression model, which is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) used for count data. Multilevel Poisson regression models account for the dependency among observations within the same cluster by incorporating random effects in the model. This approach is particularly useful when the data have a nested structure, such as students within schools or patients within hospitals.

## Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate of occurrence. The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:


$$

P(Y = y) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^y}{y!}

$$


where $Y$ is the count of events, $\lambda$ is the mean rate of occurrence, and $y$ is a non-negative integer. The Poisson distribution has the property that its mean and variance are both equal to $\lambda$.

## Poisson Regression

Poisson regression is a type of GLM used to model count data, where the response variable is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. The goal of Poisson regression is to model the mean rate of occurrence, $\lambda$, as a function of a set of predictor variables, $X$. In Poisson regression, the natural logarithm of the mean rate, $\log(\lambda)$, is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables:


$$

\log(\lambda) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p

$$


where $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ are the regression coefficients to be estimated. The estimation of the coefficients is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

## Multilevel Modeling

Multilevel modeling, also known as hierarchical linear modeling or mixed-effects modeling, is a statistical technique used to analyze data with a nested or clustered structure. In multilevel modeling, the dependency among observations within the same cluster is accounted for by incorporating random effects in the model. Random effects are unobserved variables that are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and unknown variance. They represent the variation in the outcome variable that is attributable to the clustering structure of the data.

## Multilevel Poisson Regression Model

In a multilevel Poisson regression model, the mean rate of occurrence, $\lambda$, is modeled as a function of both fixed effects and random effects. The fixed effects are the regression coefficients associated with the predictor variables, while the random effects represent the variation in the outcome variable that is attributable to the clustering structure of the data. The multilevel Poisson regression model can be written as:


$$

\log(\lambda_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1ij} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{pij} + u_{0j} + u_{1j} Z_{1j} + \cdots + u_{qj} Z_{qj}

$$


where $i$ indexes the observations within each cluster, $j$ indexes the clusters, $X_{kij}$ are the predictor variables, $Z_{kj}$ are the cluster-level variables, $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ are the fixed effects, and $u_{0j}, u_{1j}, \ldots, u_{qj}$ are the random effects. The random effects are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and an unknown covariance matrix.

The estimation of the fixed effects and random effects in a multilevel Poisson regression model can be done using various methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML), or Bayesian estimation.

## Applications

Multilevel Poisson regression models are widely used in various fields, such as education, public health, and social sciences, to analyze count data with a hierarchical or clustered structure. Some examples of applications include:

- Modeling the number of accidents at different intersections, accounting for the dependency among accidents within the same city.
- Analyzing the number of hospitalizations for a specific condition, taking into account the clustering of patients within hospitals.
- Investigating the relationship between student performance and school-level factors, while accounting for the dependency among students within the same school.

## Limitations and Extensions

Multilevel Poisson regression models assume that the mean and variance of the response variable are equal, which may not always be the case in practice. When the variance is greater than the mean, the data are said to be overdispersed. In such cases, alternative models, such as the negative binomial regression model or the zero-inflated Poisson regression model, can be used to account for the overdispersion.

Furthermore, multilevel Poisson regression models can be extended to incorporate more complex structures, such as cross-classified or multiple membership models, to better represent the dependency among observations in the data. Bayesian multilevel models can also be used to incorporate prior information and obtain more robust estimates of the fixed effects and random effects.
