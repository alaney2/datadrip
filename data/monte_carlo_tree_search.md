# Monte Carlo Tree Search

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm that is commonly used in artificial intelligence (AI) for finding optimal solutions in decision-making problems. It is a popular method in games such as chess, Go, and poker, where the number of possible moves is too large to search exhaustively. MCTS uses a combination of random sampling and tree search to efficiently explore the decision space and find the best possible move.

## Background

MCTS was first introduced in 1993 by Brugmann, Wiering, and Schaeffer as a method for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It became widely popular in the 2000s and has since been used in various games and decision-making problems. The algorithm consists of four main steps - selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation.

In the selection step, the algorithm traverses the tree from the root to a leaf node using a selection policy that balances exploration and exploitation. The most common selection policy is the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm, which selects the child node with the highest UCT value. The UCT value is calculated as a combination of the node's average reward and its exploration term, which is proportional to its visit count.

In the expansion step, the algorithm adds one or more child nodes to the selected leaf node based on the available actions. The new nodes represent the possible outcomes of the selected action.

In the simulation step, the algorithm performs a random rollout from the newly added node until a terminal state is reached. The rollout policy can be either random or guided by a heuristic function.

In the backpropagation step, the algorithm updates the reward and visit count of all the nodes traversed in the selection step, starting from the selected leaf node up to the root node.

## Applications

MCTS has been successfully applied to various games, including chess, Go, poker, and backgammon. It has also been used in robotics for planning and control, as well as in other decision-making problems such as scheduling, resource allocation, and traffic management.
