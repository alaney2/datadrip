# Differentiation Rules

In calculus, differentiation rules refer to a set of formulas that can be used to find the derivatives of various functions. These rules are important tools for solving problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields. 

## Power Rule

The power rule is used to find the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a constant. The power rule states that:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
$$

For example, if $f(x) = 5x^3$, then $f'(x) = 15x^2$.

## Sum and Difference Rule

The sum and difference rule is used to find the derivative of a sum or difference of two functions. The sum and difference rule states that:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) \pm g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) \pm \frac{d}{dx}(g(x))
$$

For example, if $f(x) = x^2 + 3x$ and $g(x) = 2x - 1$, then $f'(x) = 2x + 3$ and $g'(x) = 2$, so $(f(x) + g(x))' = f'(x) + g'(x) = 2x + 5$.

## Product Rule

The product rule is used to find the derivative of a product of two functions. The product rule states that:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x)) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$

For example, if $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 3x + 1$, then $f'(x) = 2x$ and $g'(x) = 3$, so $(f(x)g(x))' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x$.

## Quotient Rule

The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of a quotient of two functions. The quotient rule states that:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
$$

For example, if $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 3x + 1$, then $f'(x) = 2x$ and $g'(x) = 3$, so $\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)' = \frac{2x(3x+1) - x^2(3)}{(3x+1)^2} = \frac{3x^2 + 2x}{(3x+1)^2}$.

## Chain Rule

The chain rule is used to find the derivative of a composite function. The chain rule states that:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$

For example, if $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x) = 2x^2 + 1$, then $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ and $g'(x) = 4x$, so $(f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x))g'(x) = \frac{4x}{2\sqrt{2x^2+1}}$.

## Implicit Differentiation

Implicit differentiation is used to find the derivative of a function that is not explicitly defined as a function of $x$. Implicit differentiation involves taking the derivative of both sides of an equation with respect to $x$ and then solving for the derivative of the dependent variable. 

For example, if $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, then taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$ gives:

$$
2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
$$

Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ gives:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}
$$

## Conclusion

Differentiation rules are an important tool for finding derivatives of various functions. The power rule, sum and difference rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and implicit differentiation are some of the most commonly used differentiation rules. By mastering these rules, one can solve a variety of problems in calculus and beyond.
