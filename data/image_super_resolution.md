# Image Super Resolution

Image Super Resolution (ISR) is a technique to enhance the resolution of a low-resolution image by generating a high-resolution version of it. ISR is an essential component of many image-processing applications and has a wide range of applications in various fields, including medical imaging, video surveillance, and computer vision. In recent years, the advancement of Deep Learning (DL) has significantly improved the performance of ISR techniques.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of most ISR techniques. CNNs are a type of artificial neural network that can extract features from an image and produce an output that is a function of these features. These networks are composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features, while the pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the output of the convolutional layers. The fully connected layers are responsible for producing the final output of the network.

## Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent

Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are optimization techniques used in training CNNs. Backpropagation is a technique that calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. The gradients are then used to update the weights of the network using SGD. SGD is an iterative optimization algorithm that updates the weights of the network in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

## Loss Functions and Optimization Algorithms

Loss Functions and Optimization Algorithms are important components of ISR techniques. The loss function is a measure of the difference between the output of the network and the ground truth image. The optimization algorithm is responsible for minimizing the loss function. There are several optimization algorithms that can be used in training CNNs, including Adam, Adagrad, and RMSprop.

## Deep Learning Frameworks

Deep Learning Frameworks provide an environment for developing and training CNNs. These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that simplify the process of developing and training CNNs. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

## Image Processing

Image Processing is a field that deals with the processing of images to improve their quality or extract useful information from them. ISR techniques are a subset of image processing techniques. Image processing techniques such as filtering, segmentation, and feature extraction can be used in combination with ISR techniques to improve the quality of the output image.

## Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations in vector spaces. Linear algebra is an essential tool for understanding the mathematics behind CNNs and other DL techniques. Concepts such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors are commonly used in CNNs.

## Digital Signal Processing

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a field that deals with the processing of digital signals. ISR techniques can be viewed as a type of DSP technique that operates on digital images. DSP techniques such as Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, and Discrete Cosine Transform can be used in combination with ISR techniques to improve the quality of the output image.
