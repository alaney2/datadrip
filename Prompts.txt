Topic: 

Provide a JSON object containing the topic, a list of 1-12 prerequisite topics, and a list of 1-12 further readings related to AI, ML, and DL. Ensure that the prerequisites and further readings are specifically relevant to backpropagation, rather than broad topics like calculus or statistics. Use a similar format to the example provided below:

Example:
"generative_adversarial_network": {
"title": "Generative Adversarial Network",
"prerequisites": ["expectation_maximization_algorithm", "probability_distributions", "convolutional_neural_networks", "backpropagation", "stochastic_gradient_descent", "loss_functions", "optimization_algorithms", "deep_learning_frameworks", "regularization_techniques", "unsupervised_learning"],
"further_readings": ["conditional_gans", "cycle_gans", "stylegan_and_stylegan2", "wasserstein_gans", "domain_adaptation", "image_to_image_translation", "semi_supervised_learning", "adversarial_training", "adversarial_attacks_and_defenses", "transfer_learning"]
},

Next, write a detailed wiki page about backpropagation in Markdown format, from the perspective of a world-renowned AI and ML expert. Use a neutral, unbiased tone without exclamation marks, and write in the style of a melancholic older person. Follow Markdown syntax for headings and formatting, and use LaTeX for equations, with inline equations in pairs of $ and multiline equations in $$. Ensure the entire output is less than 8192 tokens long and does not include an extra line at the end of the Markdown.
