Importance sampling is a technique used to estimate the value of a function under one distribution using samples generated from a different distribution.

      "## Nash Equilibrium\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the central concepts in game theory is the Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, who introduced it in his seminal paper \"Non-Cooperative Games\" in 1950. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider the classic game of Prisoner's Dilemma, where two suspects are arrested and interrogated separately. If both confess, they each get a moderate sentence. If one confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor goes free while the other gets a harsh sentence. If both remain silent, they each get a light sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nash equilibrium of this game is for both suspects to confess, even though it leads to a worse outcome for both than if they both remained silent. This is because each suspect has an incentive to confess, regardless of what the other does, as confessing always yields a higher payoff than remaining silent.\n",

      "## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n",
      "\n",
      "In some games, there may not be a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player chooses a single strategy with certainty. Instead, there may be a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player randomizes over a set of strategies with certain probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider the game of Matching Pennies, where two players simultaneously choose heads or tails. If the choices match, player 1 wins, otherwise player 2 wins. There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, as each player's best response depends on the other's choice. However, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where each player chooses heads and tails with equal probability.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Decision Tree is a tree-like model where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the value of a single attribute. The attribute that provides the most information gain is chosen as the splitting criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information gain is a measure of the reduction in entropy achieved by partitioning the data based on a given attribute. Entropy is a measure of the impurity of a set of examples. A set with all examples belonging to the same class has an entropy of 0, while a set with an equal number of examples from each class has an entropy of 1.\n",

      "## Advantages and Disadvantages of Decision Trees\n",

      "\n",
      "However, Decision Trees can be prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Decision Trees can also be sensitive to small changes in the data, which can result in different trees being generated.\n",
